A zonal contrast in precipitation will develop at the end of the century, with an increase in precipitation over the central Sahel and a decrease in precipitation over the western Sahel. Such a zonal contrast results from the antagonist effects of the fast (due to enhanced radiative warming over land, and over the North Hemisphere, relative to the South Hemisphere) and slow (associated with long-term changes in oceanic circulation) responses of precipitation to increasing greenhouse gases. While such changes have already been assessed, less attention has been given to their temporality, an issue of major importance to promote efficient mitigation and adaptation measures. Here, we analyse the future evolution of precipitation changes decomposed into a fast and a slow response, showing that the fast response dominates the slow one. From this evidence, we highlight that mitigation strategies may be successful at reducing the effect of climate change on Sahel precipitation within a few decades, by muting the fast response. This decomposition also allows for a better understanding of the uncertainty of climate model predictions in Africa. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"climate change; climate modeling; greenhouse gas; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); temporal distribution; Sahel [Sub-Saharan Africa]","Monerie, P.-A.; National Centre for Atmospheric Science (NCAS), United Kingdom; email: pmonerie@gmail.com",,"Nature Research",23973722,,,,"English","npj Clim.

Global demand for nature-based carbon credits is outpacing their supply, due partly to gaps in knowledge needed to inform and prioritize investment decisions. Here, we show that at current carbon market prices the protection of tropical forests can generate investible carbon amounting to 1.8 (±1.1) GtCO2e yr−1 globally. We further show that financially viable carbon projects could generate return-on-investment amounting to $46.0b y−1 in net present value (Asia-Pacific: $24.6b y−1; Americas: $19.1b y−1; Africa: $2.4b y−1). However, we also find that ~80% (1.24 billion ha) of forest carbon sites would be financially unviable for failing to break even over the project lifetime. From a conservation perspective, unless carbon prices increase in the future, it is imperative to implement other conservation interventions, in addition to carbon finance, to safeguard carbon stocks and biodiversity in vulnerable forests. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"biodiversity; climate change; conservation status; nature conservation; pollution tax; tropical forest; Africa; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; Matthiola","Koh, L.P.; Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions, 14 Science Drive 4, Singapore; email: lianpinkoh@nus.edu.sg

In addition to the volatility from markets, forestry investments are directly exposed to future impacts from climate change. We examined how diversification of forest management regimes can mitigate the expected risks associated with forestry activities in New Zealand based on an application of Modern Portfolio Theory. Uncertainties in the responses of Pinus radiata (D. Don) productivity to climate change, from 2050 to 2090, were simulated with 3-PG, a process-based forest growth model, based on future climate scenarios and Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Future timber market scenarios were based on RCP-specific projections from the Global Timber Model and historical log grade prices. Outputs from 3-PG and the market scenarios were combined to compute annualized forestry returns for four P. radiata regimes for 2050–2090. This information was then used to construct optimal forestry portfolios that minimize investment risk for a given target return under different RCPs, forest productivity and market scenarios. While current P. radiata regimes in New Zealand are largely homogenous, our results suggest that regime diversification can mitigate future risks imposed by climate change and market uncertainty. Nevertheless, optimal portfolio compositions varied substantially across our range of scenarios and portfolio objectives. The application of this framework can help forest managers to better account for future risks in their management decisions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","3-PG; Climate change adaptation; Forest management; Modern portfolio theory; Representative concentration pathway","climate change; forest management; forestry production; growth response; market conditions; pine; plantation forestry; risk assessment; article; climate change; forest management; human; investment; manager; New Zealand; nonhuman; pine; price; productivity; simulation; theoretical study; uncertainty; New Zealand; Pinus radiata; Radiata","West, T.A.P.; Scion—New Zealand Forest Research InstituteNew Zealand; email: thales.west@scionreseach.com",,"Academic Press",03014797,,JEVMA,"33813299","English","J.

The effects of these countermeasures on the upgrade requirements and hydraulic performances of existing water distribution systems (WDSs) and sanitary sewers (SSs) are analyzed in this study. In addition to the common two-objective problems, a three-objective problem that provides cost-effective water-saving schemes (WSSs) that also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions have been proposed. In order to obtain and analyze solutions for all the aforementioned optimizations, the tasks of selecting WSSs considering different performances were formulated and solved as multiobjective optimization problems. The objectives considered are the minimization of the overall cost (i.e., less savings) versus minimization of water demand or maximization of network upgrade postponement introduced by WSS measures. Optimizing the GHG emissions and reductions to any of these two-objective problems completes a three-objective problem. The decision variables are the domestic water saving appliance and fitting capacities, and the tank sizes of the rainwater harvesting systems (RWHSs). The method provides Pareto fronts, which are the outputs from a nondominated sorting genetic algorithm. The proposed method was applied to the subsystems of the Tsholofelo WDS and sanitary sewer (SS) in Gaborone, Botswana. The results indicate that three-objective climate change counteractive WSSs are more desirable than two-objective WSSs. Solutions obtained considering WDS demand or the WDS only excluding the corresponding SS would undesirably impact the hydraulics and SS upgrade requirements and vice versa. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Climate change mitigation; Optimization; Sanitary sewers (SSs); Water distribution systems (WDSs); Water saving schemes (WSSs); Water-saving","Cost effectiveness; Domestic appliances; Gas emissions; Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Multiobjective optimization; Sanitary sewers; Water conservation; Water distribution systems; Climate change mitigation; Decision variables; Fitting capacity; Hydraulic performance; Multi-objective optimization problem; Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithms; Rainwater harvesting system; Water distribution system (WDSs); Climate change; climate change; cost analysis; optimization; sanitation; sewer network; water demand; water management; water use efficiency","Basupi, I.; Climate Change Div., Private Bag 0082, Plot 50654, Machel Dr., Botswana; email: ibasupi@yahoo.co.uk",,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",10760342,,,,"English","J.

However, existing methodologies based on the comparison of the total energy use and/or accountable greenhouse gas emissions of two different years do not lead to an isolated quantification of the effects of local policy actions. This happens because many causes of change in the local energy use and accountable emissions are not designed and/or controlled by the local authorities, namely economic dynamics, and national policies. This paper proposes a new model for disaggregating the total observed changes into a number of sources of change, thus enabling an estimated quantification of the effects originating from local policies alone.

Climate change debates advocate that although urban areas largely contribute to climate change they also play an important role in addressing it. This research puts forth an effort to identify whether statistically significant relationships exist between carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and urban planning policies, as well as between CO2 emissions and gender. In this regard, this research investigates whether urban planning policies in master plans have an impact on local CO2 emission levels. As a first step, a qualitative content analysis of the policy framework of sampled master plans that were involved in the sample was undertaken and climate change mitigation indexes were developed by assessing the sampled master plan's urban policies against climate change mitigation evaluation protocols. Later, using climate change mitigation, the impact of urban planning policies on local CO2 emissions, while controlling for socioeconomic characteristics, was examined by undertaking regression analysis. This research develops empirical evidences that analyze the impact of urban planning policies on CO2 emission levels, thereby contributing significantly to the urban planning and public policy field. This research highlights that master plans are effective tools in promoting low-carbon regions through urban planning thereby mitigating climate change. This research emphasizes urban planning as a policy tool for mitigating climate change and has an implication for mainstreaming climate change mitigation in local urban planning. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Gender; Urban planning policies","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Regression analysis; Urban planning; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Content analysis; Evaluation protocol; Planning policies; Policy framework; Regression model; Socioeconomic characteristics; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; gender relations; regression analysis; urban planning; urban policy; India","Raparthi, K.; School of Architecture and Planning, India; email: kiranmayiar@gmail.com",,"American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",07339488,,,,"English","J.

Invasive native scrub (INS) is woody vegetation that invades southern Australian rangelands and is commonly cleared to return land to agricultural production. Clearing of INS emits carbon to the atmosphere, and the retention of INS by landholders for the purpose of avoiding carbon emissions has been incentivized in Australia as an emission reduction strategy. Retaining INS, however, means land remains relatively unproductive because INS negatively impacts livestock production. This desktop study examined whether clearing INS to return an area to production, and pyrolysing residues to produce biochar, has the potential to provide climate change mitigation (the “pyrolysis scenario”). The syngas produced via pyrolysis was assumed to be used to generate electricity that was fed into the electricity grid and avoided the production of electricity from existing sources. In addition, the biochar was assumed to be applied to soils used for wheat production, giving mitigation benefits from reduced N2O emissions from fertiliser use and reduction in the use of lime to ameliorate soil acidity. Relative to clearing INS and burning residues in-situ, the pyrolysis scenario resulted in a reduction in radiative forcing of 1.28 × 10−4 W m2 ha−1 of INS managed, 25 years after clearing, and was greater than the reduction of 1.06 × 10−4 W m2 ha−1 that occurred when INS was retained. The greatest contribution to the climate change mitigation provided by the pyrolysis scenario came from avoided emissions from grid electricity production, while avoided N2O and lime emissions made a relatively minor contribution towards mitigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; emissions reductions; indirect land use change; woody plant encroachment","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Atmospheric radiation; Carbon; Electric power generation; Electric power transmission networks; Emission control; Lime; Pyrolysis; Synthesis gas manufacture; Vegetation; Agricultural areas; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction strategy; Generate electricity; Livestock production; Radiative forcings; Woody-plant encroachments; Climate change; biochar; carbon emission; climate change; invasive species; pyrolysis; soil remediation; woody plant; biochar; charcoal; nitrous oxide; agriculture; Australia; climate change; pyrolysis; soil; Agriculture; Australia; Charcoal; Climate Change; Nitrous Oxide; Pyrolysis; Soil","Simmons, A.T.; New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, 98 Victoria St, 2430, Australia; email: aaron.simmons@dpi.nsw.gov.au",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"33736413","English","Sci.

The problem with these proposals is that the diagnosis of what has led to the inability of integrated assessment modelers to properly analyze mitigation policies is wrong. The first main problem with the past use of the SSP-based mitigation scenarios is that few input variables for what is supposed to be the same SSP are given the same numerical values by different modeling teams. The more significant problem with the way in SSP-based mitigation scenarios have been used to analyze mitigation policies is that the different integrated assessment models (IAMs) have very different structures and functions. Thus, even if all the input variables comprising a single SSP had the same numerical values, the scenario results from running such a SSP through different IAMs would be quite different, leading to different understandings of the usefulness of different mitigation policies. This situation can be avoided by developing just two or three more detailed and improved IAMs focused on the critical next 10–20 years for mitigating climate change. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change mitigation; Economics of mitigation; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation scenarios; Shared Socioeconomic Pathways","Technological forecasting; Climate change mitigation; Different structure; Input variables; Integrated assessment; Integrated assessment models; Mitigation policies; Modeling team; Numerical values; Climate change; climate change; environmental policy; integrated approach; mitigation; numerical model; policy analysis; socioeconomic impact",,,"Elsevier Inc.",00401625,,,,"English","Technol.

Pure methane hydrates were formed and then partially dissociated, due to a provoked temperature increase of 2 °C. The same procedure was applied to a system composed by a core of CH4 hydrates and an external shell made with CO2 hydrates. In tests with only methane hydrate, that temperature increase caused partial hydrate dissociation, with a consequent increase in pressure about 7.81–8.42 bar. In presence of CO2 hydrate, the same temperature increase did not cause any dissociation, even if the new established condition were not suitable for CH4 hydrates stability. Results proved that CO2 is capable to form a strong hydrate shell around the methane core, which hinders its dissociation. Two positive contributions were reached: CO2 permanent storage and the prevention of CH4 release in the atmosphere. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; CO2 replacement; CO2 storage; Hydrate dissociation; Natural gas hydrate","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dissociation; Hydration; Methane; CH4 hydrates; Climate change mitigation; Hydrate dissociation; Hydrate shells; Increase in pressure; Methane hydrates; Methane release; Temperature increase; Gas hydrates",,,"Elsevier Ltd",00092509,,CESCA,,"English","Chem.

A key opportunity to replace fossil fuels across sectors is the use of renewable hydrogen. In this context, the main political and social push is currently on climate neutral hydrogen (H2 ) production through electrolysis using renewable electricity. Another climate neutral possibility that has recently gained importance is biohydrogen production from biogenic residual and waste materials. This paper introduces for the first time a novel concept for the production of hydrogen with net negative emissions. The derived concept combines biohydrogen production using biotechnological or thermochemical processes with carbon dioxide (CO2 ) capture and storage. Various process combinations referred to this basic approach are defined as HyBECCS (Hydrogen Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage) and described in this paper. The technical principles and resulting advantages of the novel concept are systematically derived and compared with other Negative Emission Technologies (NET). These include the high concentration and purity of the CO2 to be captured compared to Direct Air Carbon Capture (DAC) and Post-combustion Carbon Capture (PCC) as well as the emission-free use of hydrogen resulting in a higher possible CO2 capture rate compared to hydrocarbon-based biofuels generated with Bioenergy with Carbon Capture and Storage (BECCS) technologies. Further, the role of carbon-negative hydrogen in future energy systems is analyzed, taking into account key societal and technological drivers against the background of climate adaptation and mitigation. For this purpose, taking the example of the Federal Republic of Germany, the ecological impacts are estimated, and an economic assessment is made. For the production and use of carbon-negative hydrogen, a saving potential of 8.49–17.06 MtCO2, eq/a is estimated for the year 2030 in Germany. The production costs for carbon-negative hydrogen would have to be below 4.30 € per kg in a worst-case scenario and below 10.44 € in a best-case scenario in order to be competitive in Germany, taking into account hydrogen market forecasts. © 2021 by the authors.

Improvements have been made in different areas (i.e., technology, sustainable aviation fuel, and design) to mitigate these adverse effects. However, the rate of improvement is small compared to the increase in the demand for air transportation. Hence, greenhouse gas emissions in the aviation sector are steadily increasing and this trend is expected to continue unless adequately addressed. In this context, this study examined the following: (i) the factors that affect the growth of aviation, (ii) trends in greenhouse gas emissions in the sector, (iii) trends in energy demand, (iv) mitigation pathways of emissions, (v) mitigation challenges for the International Civil Aviation Organization, (vi) achievements in mitigating emissions, (vii) barriers against mitigating emissions, and (viii) approaches of overcoming barriers against emissions mitigation. This study finds that continued research and development efforts targeting aircraft fuel burn efficiency are crucial in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Although biofuels are promising for the reduction of aviation emissions, techniques to reduce NOx emissions could enhance large-scale deployment. Pragmatic market-based mechanisms, such as the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and/or carbon tax must be enforced on a global scale to capitalize on a collective stakeholder effort to curb CO2 emissions. The findings of this study will help in understanding the emissions and energy consumption scenarios, which will provide a comprehensive package of mitigation pathways to overcome future emissions reduction challenges in the aviation sector. © 2021 by the authors.

First, what kind of actions help in avoiding, shifting and improving demand for activities/services and resultant emissions to help in deciding choices for actions; second, how these three categories of actions are linked to the wider impact on human wellbeing represented by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) framework; and third, who are the actors associated with these mitigation actions. These three steps become important in the targeted scaling up of actions through policy interventions. This study undertakes a review of the literature between 2015 and 2020 with systematic evidence searching and screening. The literature search has been conducted in Scopus Database. From over 6887 literature in the initial search, 294 relevant literature were finally reviewed to link demand side interventions of avoid-shift-improve (ASI) categories to SDGs. It also maps these actions to actors who can lead the changes. Results show that a wide range of improvement actions are already helping in incremental steps to reduce demand and emissions in various services like mobility, shelter and industrial products. However, ASI categories provide more distinct mitigation actions. All actions need support of innovation, infrastructure development and industrialization. Actions that interact with several SDGs include active mode of transport, passive building design, cleaner cooking, and circular economy. Positive links of these actions to multiple SDGs are overall very strong; however, few trade-offs have been observed. These are mostly related to distributional impact across social groups which highlight the need for policy attention and hard infrastructure design changes. Mitigation and wider benefit outcomes cannot be achieved by individual or household level actions alone. They require the involvement of multiple actors, interconnected actions in sequence as well as in parallel, and support of hard infrastructure. Our results show that in mobility services, policy makers supported by spatial planners and service delivery providers are the major actors. In industry, major actors are policy makers followed by spatial planners and innovators. For buildings, key actors include spatial planners followed by policy makers. Besides these, strategic information sharing to enhance user awareness and education plays an important role in shaping behaviour. Digitalization, information and communication, and interactive technologies will play a significant role in understanding and modifying people's choices; however, these would also require regulatory attention. © 2021 The Author(s).

Yet its net effects on mobility-related CO2 emissions are complex and under-researched. Here we collected travel activity data in seven European cities and derived life cycle CO2 emissions across modes and purposes. Daily mobility-related life cycle CO2 emissions were 3.2 kgCO2 per person, with car travel contributing 70% and cycling 1%. Cyclists had 84% lower life cycle CO2 emissions than non-cyclists. Life cycle CO2 emissions decreased by −14% per additional cycling trip and decreased by −62% for each avoided car trip.

The present communication reviews the impact of heat stress on production, reproduction and growth performance of poultry, and its alleviation using genetic strategies. The adverse effects of high environmental temperature on poultry include decrease in growth rate, body weight, egg production, egg weight, egg quality, meat quality, semen quality, fertility and hatchability, which cause vast financial losses to the poultry industry. High ambient temperature has an antagonistic effect on performance traits of the poultry. Thus, selection of birds for high performance has increased their susceptibility to heat stress. Additionally, heat burden during transportation of birds from one place to another leads to reduced meat quality, increased mortality and welfare issues. Molecular markers are being explored nowadays to recognize the potential candidate genes related to production, reproduction and growth traits for selecting poultry birds to enhance thermo-tolerance and resistance against diseases. In conclusion, there is a critical need of formulating selection strategies based on genetic markers and exploring more genes in addition to HSP25, 70, 90, H1, RB1CC, BAG3, PDK, ID1, Na, F, dw and K responsible for thermoregulation, to improve the overall performance of poultry along with their ability to tolerate heat stress conditions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Heat stress; Mitigation; Poultry; Production; Reproduction",,"Kumar, M.; Department of Livestock Farm Complex, India; email: drmanojneemwal@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03064565,,JTBID,,"English","J.

Co-impacts assessment seeks to identify these co-benefits and adverse side-effects. Understanding of co-impacts can provide the knowledge base to garner support for mitigation actions, and to plan interventions that realize synergistic opportunities and contribute simultaneously to multiple objectives, increasing the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of climate actions. However, the value of this information is determined by the manner in which it is framed and communicated. In this paper, the relationships between climate change mitigation action and co-impacts and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are explored and illustrated using a selection of examples from countries’ Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). We suggest that in the context of SDGs, the co-benefits approach could provide a cohesive framing to incentivize stakeholders to work together to garner support for ambitious policy which simultaneously achieves climate change mitigation and non-climate objectives. Similarly, understanding of adverse side-effects can help to ensure that trade-offs with delivery of the SDGs arising from mitigation actions are recognised and minimised.

For this reason, there is a need for a review of building standards and adaptation to the context of energy performance in planning future projects. The objective of this research was to ascertain the thermal transmittance of external walls for single-family homes and to establish the energetically optimal thickness of thermal insulation by using an energy simulation to maintain heating energy consumption in conditions of climate change while following the state regulations in the Los Ríos region of Chile. It was demonstrated that for each time period and in each geographical location of the region the optimal U-value of the external walls is different. For a house to have a heating energy consumption corresponding to 90 kWh/m2/year, it must have an optimal average U-value of the walls of 0.49 ± 0.11 W/m2K (year 2006 in the study region); however, for the period 2035–2050, this value is expected to reach 0.78 ± 0.14 W/m2K. In addition, it was shown that designing the house with an energy performance perspective of 15 years helps to reduce the carbon footprint of the use of thermal insulation in the walls by 20%.

However, the sustainability of the sector is at stake due to the predicted effects of climate change that are not only a future but also a present reality. In this paper, we review the potential effects of climate change on aquaculture production and its implications on the sector's sustainability. Various elements of a changing climate, such as rising temperatures, sea-level rise, diseases and harmful algal blooms, changes in rainfall patterns, the uncertainty of external inputs supplies, changes in sea surface salinity, and severe climatic events have been discussed. Furthermore, several adaptation options have been presented as well as some gaps in existing knowledge that require further investigations. Overall, climate change effects and implications on aquaculture production sustainability are expected to be both negative and positive although, the negative effects outweigh the positive ones. Adapting to the predicted changes in the short-term while taking mitigation measures in the long-term could be the only way toward sustaining the sector's production. However, successful adaptation will depend on the adaptive capacity of the producers in different regions of the world. © Copyright © 2021 Maulu, Hasimuna, Haambiya, Monde, Musuka, Makorwa, Munganga, Phiri and Nsekanabo.","adaptation; aquaculture production; climate change; effects; greenhouse gases; sustainability",,"Maulu, S.; Centre for Innovative Approach ZambiaZambia; email: sahyamaulu@gmail.com

The un-precedented global effects of climate change are wide‐ranging, including changing weather patterns that threaten food production, increased risk of catastrophic floods, and rising sea levels. Adapting to these impacts will be more difficult and costly in the future if radical changes are not made now. This review paper evaluates the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries’ potential for solar and wind energy resources to meet climate change mitigation requirements and assesses the ability of the GCC region to shift towards low‐carbon technologies. The review demonstrates that the GCC region is characterized by abundant solar energy resources. The northwestern, southeastern, and western mountains of the region are highlighted as locations for solar energy application. Oman displays the highest onshore wind speed range, 3–6.3 m s⁻1, and has the highest annual solar radiation of up to 2500 kWh/m2. Kuwait has the second highest onshore wind speed range, 4.5–5.5 m s⁻1, particularly in the western mountains, while northwestern Saudi Arabia has a range of 3–6 m s⁻1. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has the second highest annual solar radiation, 2285 kWh/m2, while Saudi Arabia and the state of Kuwait have equal annual solar radiation at 2200 kWh/m2. This review demonstrates that abundant offshore wind energy resources were observed along the coastal areas of the Arabian Gulf, as well as a potential opportunity for wind energy resource development in the Red Sea, which was characterized by high performance. In addition, the GCC countries will not be able to control and address the interrelated issues of climate change in the future if they do not eliminate fossil fuel consumption, adhere to the Paris Agreement, and implement plans to utilize their natural resources to meet these challenges. © 2021 by the authors.

However, in the midst of geoengineering and other large-scale proposals, such as reducing emissions at an industrial level, the role of individual actions to reduce emissions is often overlooked. Given the current and fast-paced changes we have seen as emissions are reduced by COVID-19 social distancing strategies, it is time to re-examine the impact that individual actions can have. This paper considers how one individual action (reducing carbon dioxide emissions from gasoline-fueled private vehicles), when adopted at a global scale, may have an effect that is comparable to the effects of geoengineering. This paper also argues that the role of geoengineering as a safeguard against climate change may be encouraging complacency and reducing motivation for individual action. © 2021.

To date, relatively little research has been carried out on young people’s skills in terms of them mitigating and, in particular, adapting to the changes caused by climate change. The complex climate change issues of mitigation and adaptation are conceptually difficult for children because climate change is not directly evidenced in their daily lives. This study focuses on looking at mitigation and adaptation from the perspective of children. Meaning-making coping strategies enable the maintenance of constructive hope regarding climate change. In the present study, elementary and secondary students (n = 950) responded to an online questionnaire. Statistical methods were used to gather data on how students’ general knowledge of climate change and their mitigation and adaptation knowledge predicted their constructive hope regarding climate change. This study reveals that the students had a relatively high level of constructive hope and that general climate change knowledge predicted students’ constructive hope well. © 2021 by the author.

Romania, in line with the Union’s objectives, resorted to the application of a system of environmental taxes and provided in the budgetary policy government expenditures for environmental protection. The aim of the research is to highlight the effects of these measures on the environment by analysing the short-run and long-run causal relationships between greenhouse gas emissions, green taxes and government expenditures on environmental protection. Autoregressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) method and Granger causality tests were used to demonstrate the existence of these relationships and the intensity with which they manifest. Following the analysis, we identified a significant long-run influence of government spending on environmental protection on greenhouse gas emissions but also numerous short-run and long-run causal relationships between greenhouse gas emissions and green taxes, applied in Romania. The results of the research consider the impact of public expenses for environment protection, a variable not yet applied for Romania, on greenhouse gas emissions’ decrease, in correlation with environmental taxes per source of origin. © 2021 by the authors.

This lag may be caused, in part, by the psychological distance between decision-makers today and those who will likely experience the worst impacts of climate change in the future. This psychological distance reduces the salience of those impacts in today’s decisions. In a randomized control experiment using a letter-to-the-future treatment and a climate change essay treatment, I find that compared to a control group, both writing tasks that focus attention on the future risks of climate change increase the willingness to donate to climate change mitigation efforts. I also find evidence that for parents and grandparents, writing a letter to one’s child or grandchild increases the salience of existing concerns about how climate change may impact one’s children. These findings contribute to the understanding of how to bridge the psychological distance between choices and consequences for climate change mitigation and have implications for a wide range of decisions from personal health choices to retirement savings. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate change mitigation; Framing theory; Intergenerational framing; Psychological distance; Randomized control experiment; Salience","Decision making; Economics; Climate change mitigation; Control experiments; Control groups; Decision makers; Personal health; Psychological distance; Willingness to donate; Willingness to pay; Climate change; climate change; decision making; environmental risk; future prospect; psychology; willingness to pay","Shrum, T.R.; University of VermontUnited States; email: tshrum@uvm.edu",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

However, given these topics are not investigated by a single epistemic community, the literature base underpinning the associated research continues to be undefined. Here, we aim to delineate a plausible body of literature capturing a comprehensive spectrum of demand, services and social aspects of climate change mitigation. As method we use a novel double-stacked expert-machine learning research architecture and expert evaluation to develop a typology and map key messages relevant for climate change mitigation within this body of literature. First, relying on the official key words provided to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change by governments (across 17 queries), and on specific investigations of domain experts (27 queries), we identify 121 165 non-unique and 99 065 unique academic publications covering issues relevant for demand-side mitigation. Second, we identify a literature typology with four key clusters: policy, housing, mobility, and food/consumption. Third, we systematically extract key content-based insights finding that the housing literature emphasizes social and collective action, whereas the food/consumption literatures highlight behavioral change, but insights also demonstrate the dynamic relationship between behavioral change and social norms. All clusters point to the possibility of improved public health as a result of demand-side solutions. The centrality of the policy cluster suggests that political actions are what bring the different specific approaches together. Fourth, by mapping the underlying epistemic communities we find that researchers are already highly interconnected, glued together by common interests in sustainability and energy demand. We conclude by outlining avenues for interdisciplinary collaboration, synthetic analysis, community building, and by suggesting next steps for evaluating this body of literature. © 2021 The Author(s).

One crucial concern is whether geoengineering crowds out efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Adding to a limited body of empirical evidence, we use a survey experiment to estimate how informing the U.S. public about solar geoengineering impacts support for a proposed national carbon tax. In contrast to the crowding-out hypothesis, we find that respondents who are provided with information about geoengineering are significantly more likely to support the tax. Further, we document systematic variation as people with egalitarian and communitarian worldviews are more responsive to the information relative to those with hierarchical and individualist worldviews. Our study suggests that the availability and awareness of solar geoengineering options may lead to an increase in greenhouse gas abatement efforts. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Emissions; Experiment; Moral hazard; Solar geoengineering","Behavioral research; Carbon; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; A-carbon; Carbon taxes; Climate change mitigation; Crowding out; Geoengineering; Greenhouse gas abatements; Stated preferences; Systematic variation; Climate change","Cherry, T.L.; University of WyomingUnited States; email: tcherry@uwyo.edu",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Today, many countries, regions, and cities around the world are implementing policies and strategies to adapt to climate change and mitigate its effects. A scoping review was performed to identify tools and methods that help integrate health into climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies. The literature search includes scientific and grey literature. The scientific literature was conducted using PubMed, Elsevier Embase, and Web of Science databases. A grey literature web search was performed to complement the results. A total of 35 studies (28 from the scientific literature and 7 from the grey literature) were finally included. A large majority of research articles (24/28) and almost all reports (6/7) from the grey literature were published after 2010. Results show that the tools that were found most frequently are the nested models (12/35), health impact assessment (6/35), vulnerability and adaptation assessment (3/35), conceptual frameworks (3/35), and mixed methods (3/35). This review shows an increasing interest in the topic of developing tools to better manage health issues in adaptation and mitigation strategies, with a recent increase in the number of publications. Additional analyses of tools’ effectiveness should be conducted in further studies. © 2021 by the authors.

In responding to this urgent and growing public health crisis, mitigation strategies are in place to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) while adaptation strategies exist to reduce and/or alleviate the adverse effects of climate change by increasing systems’ resilience to future impacts. While these strategies have numerous positive benefits on climate change itself, they also often have other positive externalities or health co-benefits. This knowledge can be harnessed to promote and improve global public health, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Previous conceptual models in mitigation and adaptation studies such as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) considered health in the thinking, but health outcomes were not their primary intention. Additionally, existing guidance documents such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities is designed primarily for public health professionals or healthcare managers in hospital settings with a primary focus on resilience. However, a detailed cross sectoral and multidisciplinary conceptual framework, which links mitigation and adaptation strategies with health outcomes as a primary end point, has not yet been developed to guide research in this area. In this paper, we briefly summarize the burden of climate change on global public health, describe important mitigation and adaptation strategies, and present key health benefits by giving context specific examples from high, middle, and low-income settings. We then provide a conceptual framework to inform future global public health research and preparedness across sectors and disciplines and outline key stakeholders recommendations in promoting climate resilient systems and advancing health equity. © 2021 by the authors.

Yet the net effects of changes in active travel on changes in mobility-related CO2 emissions are complex and under-researched. Here we collected longitudinal data on daily travel behavior, journey purpose, as well as personal and geospatial characteristics in seven European cities and derived mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions over time and space. Statistical modelling of longitudinal panel (n = 1849) data was performed to assess how changes in active travel, the ‘main mode’ of daily travel, and cycling frequency influenced changes in mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions. We found that changes in active travel have significant lifecycle carbon emissions benefits, even in European urban contexts with already high walking and cycling shares. An increase in cycling or walking consistently and independently decreased mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions, suggesting that active travel substituted for motorized travel – i.e. the increase was not just additional (induced) travel over and above motorized travel. To illustrate this, an average person cycling 1 trip/day more and driving 1 trip/day less for 200 days a year would decrease mobility-related lifecycle CO2 emissions by about 0.5 tonnes over a year, representing a substantial share of average per capita CO2 emissions from transport. The largest benefits from shifts from car to active travel were for business purposes, followed by social and recreational trips, and commuting to work or place of education. Changes to commuting emissions were more pronounced for those who were younger, lived closer to work and further to a public transport station. Even if not all car trips could be substituted by active travel the potential for decreasing emissions is considerable and significant. The study gives policy and practice the empirical evidence needed to assess climate change mitigation impacts of urban transport measures and interventions aimed at mode shift to more sustainable modes of transport. Investing in and promoting active travel whilst ‘demoting’ private car ownership and use should be a cornerstone of strategies to meet ‘net zero’ carbon targets, particularly in urban areas, while also reducing inequalities and improving public health and quality of urban life in a post-COVID-19 world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Active travel; Climate change mitigation; Cycling; Lifecycle CO2 emissions; Sustainable urban transport; Walking","car ownership; carbon emission; climate change; life cycle analysis; sustainability; urban area; Europe","Brand, C.; Environmental Change Institute, South Parks Road, United Kingdom; email: christian.brand@ouce.ox.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

In an experiment with U.S. participants, we found that conservatives and moderates are more supportive of climate change mitigation when exposed to information about mitigation actions taken by the private sector. These results suggest that the private sector initiatives may be a way to bolster support for climate action across the U.S. political spectrum. We also tested for downstream spillover effects and found mixed results: Compared to reading about government regulations to mitigate climate change, reading about private sector climate actions led to both increased and decreased support for government-led further mitigation through two different pathways. We found an indirect positive spillover effect in which conservatives and moderates perceived private approaches to be feasible and effective, leading to more mitigation support. However, we also found an indirect negative spillover effect in which reading about private section mitigation actions reduced concern about climate change among conservatives and moderates, thus decreasing their support for government policies to mitigate climate change. These indirect positive and negative spillover effects appear to cancel each other out. Additionally, when comparing the effect of reading about private sector action to reading specifically about a carbon tax (rather than other government regulations) there were no spillover effects. We explore the policy and behavioral implications of these findings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change policy; Climate communications; Ideology; Mitigation support; Private sector climate approaches; Solution aversion",,"Gillis, A.514 Moore Building, Penn State University, University Park, United States; email: ajg54@psu.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

Grounded in an expert guided literature review of 198 studies and their corresponding 332 case studies, it assesses the linkages between low carbon transitions—including renewable electricity, biofuel, nuclear power, smart grids, electric vehicles, and land use management—with degradation, dispossession and destruction. It draws on a framework that envisions the political ecology of low-carbon transitions as consisting of four distinct processes: enclosure (capture of land or resources), exclusion (unfair planning), encroachment (destruction of the environment), or entrenchment (worsening of inequality or vulnerability). The study vigorously interrogates how these elements play out by country and across countries, by type of mitigation option, by type of victim or affected group, by process, and by severity, e.g. from modern slavery to organized crime, from violence, murder and torture to the exacerbation of child prostitution or the destruction of pristine ecosystems. It also closely examines the locations, disciplinary affiliations, methods and spatial units of analysis employed by this corpus of research, with clear and compelling insights for future work in the space of geography, climate change, and energy transitions. It suggest five critical avenues for future research: greater inclusivity and diversity, rigor and comparative analysis, focus on mundane technologies and non-Western case studies, multi-scalar analysis, and focus on policy and recommendations. At times, low-carbon transitions and climate action can promote squalor over sustainability and leave angry communities, disgruntled workers, scorned business partners, and degraded landscapes in their wake. Nevertheless, ample opportunities exist to make a future low-carbon world more pluralistic, democratic, and just. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Energy transitions; Low-carbon transitions; Mobility; Political ecology; Political economy; Renewable energy",,"Sovacool, B.K.; Science Policy Research Unit (SPRU), United Kingdom; email: B.Sovacool@sussex.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

It analyses their historical performance in terms of energy system and greenhouse gas emissions indicators. In cases where policies aim to reduce future emissions, their target performance levels are assessed. The review centres on the sectors of electricity generation, passenger vehicles, freight transport, forestry, industry, buildings, agriculture, and oil and gas production. Most focus countries have implemented successful policies for renewable energy, fuel efficiency, electrification of passenger vehicles, and forestry. For other sectors, information is limited or very heterogeneous (e.g. buildings, appliances, agriculture) or there are few comprehensive policies in place (e.g. industry). The article further presents an explorative emissions scenario developed under the assumption that all countries will replicate both the observed trends in sector-level indicators and the trends that policies for future emissions reductions aspire to achieve. It shows that the global replication of sector progress would reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 by about 20% compared to a current policies scenario. All countries analysed would overachieve the emissions reduction targets in their post-2020 climate targets. However, the resulting reduction in global emissions by 2030 would still not be sufficient to keep the world on track for a global cost-effective pathway that keeps temperature increase below 2°C. The findings of this study emphasise the need for transformative policies to keep the Paris Agreement temperature limit within reach. © 2020 The Authors","Greenhouse gas emissions reductions; Nationally determined contributions; Policy review; Replication of progress; Sector climate policy; Sector progress","Agricultural robots; Cost effectiveness; Emission control; Forestry; Freight transportation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum industry; Petroleum transportation; Temperature; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Emissions reduction; Emissions scenarios; Greenhouse gas emissions indicators; Historical performance; Oil and gas production; Temperature increase; Climate change","Fekete, H.; NewClimate InstituteGermany; email: h.fekete@newclimate.org

Among the sixty-four species of seagrass, Posidonia oceanica, a Mediterranean endemic species, appears to be the most effective in carbon fixation and storage. Based on new data from the study of one of the largest P. oceanica meadows in the Mediterranean Sea (100 km of coastline, 20 425 ha), and a synthesis of available data from the whole of the Mediterranean basin, the aim of this work is to evaluate the amount of carbon fixed each year by P. oceanica and sequestered in the matte, in relation with the mitigation of the impact of climate change (carbon sink). The mean total carbon fixation (blades, sheaths and rhizomes) per year varies between 33.5 and 426.6 g C.m−2 and the mean carbon sequestration (long-term sink in the matte), corresponding to the sheath and rhizome tissues, varies between 7.7 and 84.4 g C.m−2, with a clear decreasing trend according to depth because of the meadow density decrease. The synthesis of a hundred measurements made throughout the Mediterranean Sea and at depths between 0.5 and 32.0 m provides a basis for estimating the average annual carbon fixation and sequestration rate throughout the Mediterranean basin. The fixation of the blades is estimated at 1 024 t C.ha−1.yr−1, that of the sheaths at 220 t C ha−1.yr−1 and that of the rhizomes at 58 t C ha−1.yr−1; i.e. a total fixation rate of 1 302 t C ha−1.yr−1 and sequestration rate (dead sheaths and rhizomes) of 278 t C ha−1.yr−1. This annual carbon fixation represents only 0.61% on average of CO2 emissions/releases for all Mediterranean countries but in the large Mediterranean islands this fixation is on average 3.1% and can reach almost 14.4% for Corsica. Moreover, the major advantage of the P. oceanica meadow lies in its capacity to store carbon from annual carbon sequestration for centuries to millennia and can be compared to several terrestrial ecosystems considered to be efficient in carbon storage (peatlands). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fixation; Carbon sequestration; Corsica; Mediterranean Sea; Posidonia oceanica; Seagrass","Carbon capture; Digital storage; Forestry; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Marine vegetation; Mediterranean basin; Mediterranean countries; Mediterranean sea; Posidonia oceanica; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change; carbon fixation; carbon sink; carbon storage; climate change; peatland; seagrass meadow; Corse; France; Mediterranean Coast [France]; Posidonia oceanica; Alismatales; climate change; ecosystem; France; Mediterranean Sea; Alismatales; Climate Change; Ecosystem; France; Mediterranean Sea","Pergent-Martini, C.; FRES 3041 – UMR 6134, Corte, France; email: pmartini@univ-corse.fr",,"Elsevier Ltd",01411136,,MERSD,"33360312","English","Mar.

Thus the study was conducted to estimate the carbon stock potential of the Sekele Mariam forest, North Western Ethiopia. The field data were collected through systematic random sampling techniques from the 20 m × 20 m area of 48 sample plots. The above-ground biomass, below-ground biomass, dead tree, and deadwood biomass of the study area were collected from 20 m × 20 m area of the main plot, while the soil sample and litter biomass was collected from 1 m × 1 m area of subplots, which located at the four corners and one at the center of the main plot. The carbon stock of different carbon pools was estimated using different selective allometric and mathematical models and analyzed by statistical package for social science (SPSS) software version 21. The result showed that the mean carbon stock of each carbon pool such as above-ground carbon, below-ground carbon, dead tree, and deadwood carbon, litter carbon, and soil organic carbon accounted for about 362.72, 72.55, 3.43, 2.01, and 179.68 t/ha, respectively.

One of the key findings in the economics literature is that the use of natural resources contributes to real income per capita. However, its environmental consequences should not be ignored. This paper examines the nexus among CO2 emission, real income, and natural resources, by incorporating urbanization, and trade in Pakistan from 1971 to 2017. The Auto-Regressive Distributive Lag (ARDL) and Vector Error Correction (VECM) models are used for analyzing time-series data. The empirical findings infer that the use of natural resources accelerates the rate of CO2 emission in Pakistan which worsens environmental quality. In addition, the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) is confirmed in the presence of natural resource use. Besides, urbanization improves environmental quality through mitigating the level of CO2 emission. Moreover, the feedback hypothesis is found between the use of natural resources and CO2 emission. Additionally, bidirectional causality is found between urbanization and the use of natural resources. Overall, this study supports formulating new policies to overcome environmental degradation through energy-saving technologies. © The Author(s) 2020.","Climate change; CO2 emissions; Environmental Kuznets Curve; natural resources; Pakistan","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Error correction; Sustainable development; Empirical findings; Energy-saving technologies; Environmental consequences; Environmental Kuznets curves; Environmental quality; Natural resource use; Sustainable economic development; Vector error correction; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; environmental economics; income; Kuznets curve; mitigation; natural resource; sustainable development; urbanization; Pakistan","Lee, C.-C.; Research Center of the Central China for Economic and Social Development, China; email: cclee6101@gmail.com

Mitigating climate change has become necessary because of the effects it has on social, economic and environmental outcomes. The minutest action taken against climate change can reduce its devastating impacts. Hence, this study assesses the strategies used by manufacturing companies in mitigating climate change. The study location is Ota, Nigeria. In this paper, a quantitative research approach was adopted with questionnaires distributed to participants at a climate change workshop, which is analysed using statistical techniques. The results show, among others, that all the respondents are aware of climate change and the most common source of climate change knowledge is the mass media. Moreover, most of the respondents describe climate change as a rise in global temperatures. Waste reduction, waste recycling, and waste reuse are the most common climate change mitigation strategies adopted by the manufacturing companies. Other mitigation strategies include: use of energy-saving bulbs in offices and factories and switching off electrical appliances when not in use. Although the findings indicate that the manufacturing companies are taking some steps to mitigate climate change, a lot still has to be done in reducing carbon emission levels, particularly during the manufacturing process. It is also essential that manufacturers use renewable energy sources as alternative power instead of diesel generators so that the volume of atmospheric carbon in the region can be reduced considerably. The role of government in driving emission reduction is also emphasised. The study provides baseline data that can be used in the development and implementation of policies on regional climate change mitigation strategies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","global warming; renewable energy; sustainability; sustainable development; sustainable manufacturing","Carbon; Emission control; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Manufacture; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Surveys; Sustainable development; Atmospheric greenhouse; Climate change mitigation; Environmental outcome; Manufacturing companies; Manufacturing process; Regional climate changes; Renewable energy source; Statistical techniques; Climate change","Tunji-Olayeni, P.F.; Regional Centre of Expertise (RCE)Nigeria; email: pat.tunji-olayeni@covenantuniversity.edu.ng","Aizebeokhai A.P.Emetere M.E.Adagunodo T.A.","IOP Publishing Ltd",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Thus, cultivars resistant to climate change are alternatives. This study was aimed at examining the adaptation capability of selected lines and varieties of tomato and chilli in farmers' lands. Five improved lines and varieties of chilli and tomato were selected. The trials were conducted using a randomized block design in upland and lowland to understand the response of selected cultivars in a new agroecosystem. There were three replications at each site. Agronomic aspects were used as performance indicators. The results showed significant differences in each site. Several improved lines of chilli showed better performance than others in high altitude. However, the performance depends on the altitude and season. Lines performed better at high altitude and could not result in the same at low altitude. This is the same case as the tomato. Some lines showed good performance in upland, but they did not show in lowland, and vice versa. Based on the finding, it is recommended that farmers are expected to select the best lines accordingly to the locations they will cultivate tomato and chilli. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Design of experiments; Fruits; Land use; Agro ecosystems; Block designs; Low altitudes; Performance indicators; Sustainable production; Climate change","Latifah, E.; East Java Assessment Institute for Agricultural TechnologyIndonesia; email: epilatip08@gmail.com",,"IOP Publishing Ltd",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Our study aimed to estimate land use change and its impact on net carbon emissions, as well as to formulate strategies for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change downstream of a National park. We analyzed land cover changes from satellite imagery and measured carbon stocks in biomass, necromass and soil (0 to 30 cm) pools. Satellite imagery of land cover in 1994, 2001, 2011 and 2017 showed a decrease in natural forest area and an increase in the area of shrubs, agroforestry, production forests and annual crop land. Net CO2 emission increased from 2.4 to 6.4 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the periods 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Sand mining is the most destructive land use pattern in the area, as it leaves soil profiles stripped of their topsoil. Vulnerability to less reliable rainfall has been addressed by the common creation of small reservoirs and the abundant use of irrigation for vegetables growing under partial shade in the agroforestry zone. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon; Catchments; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Land use; Satellite imagery; Soils; Carbon emissions; Global climates; Land use pattern; Land-cover change; Land-use change; National parks; Natural forests; Small reservoirs; Climate change","Hairiah, K.; Soil Science Department, Indonesia; email: kurniatun_h@ub.ac.id",,"IOP Publishing Ltd",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Thus, the land sector plays a crucial role in the context of climate change, being both a contributor to the problem and part of its solution, particularly thanks to the capacity of soils and biomass to sequester atmospheric carbon. The challenge of this paper is to understand the extent to which sustainable land management can be a valuable solution for increasing the mitigation potential of the land sector, particularly at small-scale rural landscape level.The paper presents and tests a land-based approach to be applied at small-scale rural landscape level, aiming at reducing and offsetting GHG emissions from the livestock activities, one of the main sources of GHG emissions of the whole agricultural sector. The proposed land-based approach builds on an ensemble of methodologies, including Geographic Information System (GIS) elaboration, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) and methodologies from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), that allow estimating livestock GHG emissions and the mitigation potential of sustainable land-use options applied in the same small-scale rural landscape.Results from a case study in Italy show that land-based mitigation options applied at small-scale rural landscape level can reduce and completely offset the GHG livestock emissions of the same area, leading to carbon neutral livestock systems. Thus, this study confirms that the land sector can strongly contribute to climate change mitigation if sustainable land-use options are applied. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Land sector; Land-based approach; Land-based mitigation options; Life cycle assessment (LCA); Livestock GHG emissions; Sustainable land management","Agricultural robots; Carbon; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Life cycle; Rural areas; Agricultural sector; Atmospheric carbon; Climate change mitigation; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mitigation options; Sustainable land managements; Sustainable land use; Climate change","Chiriacò, M.V.; CMCC – Fondazione Centro Euro-Mediterraneo Sui Cambiamenti Climatici, Viale Trieste, 127, Italy; email: mariavincenza.chiriaco@cmcc.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

However, there are important differences between carbon dioxide (CO2), which is a stock pollutant, and methane (CH4), which is predominantly a flow pollutant. These dynamics mean that conventional reporting of aggregated CO2-equivalent emission rates is highly ambiguous and does not straightforwardly reflect historical or anticipated contributions to global temperature change. As a result, the roles and responsibilities of different sectors emitting different gases are similarly obscured by the common means of communicating emission reduction scenarios using CO2-equivalence. We argue for a shift in how we report agricultural greenhouse gas emissions and think about their mitigation to better reflect the distinct roles of different greenhouse gases. Policy-makers, stakeholders, and society at large should also be reminded that the role of agriculture in climate mitigation is a much broader topic than climate science alone can inform, including considerations of economic and technical feasibility, preferences for food supply and land-use, and notions of fairness and justice. A more nuanced perspective on the impacts of different emissions could aid these conversations. © Copyright © 2021 Lynch, Cain, Frame and Pierrehumbert.","agriculture; climate change; climate policy; CO2; methane; nitrous oxide",,"Lynch, J.; Department of Physics, United Kingdom; email: john.lynch@physics.ox.ac.uk",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2571581X,,,,"English","Front.

Colombo, Sri Lanka was recently declared as one of the eighteen global Ramsar wetland cities. The current study represents the first attempt to quantify soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks held by the urban freshwater wetlands in Colombo. The study focused on the extensive urban wetland ecosystems of Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park. SOC stocks were determined using three parameters: depth of soil, bulk density, and SOC concentration. Loss on ignition method was used in quantifying SOC concentrations. Average SOC stocks, up to a depth of 60 cm at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park were estimated at 504 ± 14 t C/ha and 550 ± 23 t C/ha, respectively. Furthermore, the total SOC stock at Kolonnawa wetland and Thalawathugoda wetland park were estimated at 198,408 ± 5564 t CO2eq and 66,313 ± 2764 t CO2eq, respectively. When considering global estimates, it was found that freshwater wetlands in Colombo hold a higher SOC stock than tropical wet forests and tropical dry forests.

This study takes the case of study of Canary Islands, where there are more than 320 desalination plants with different sizes, private, and public. The objective is to propose a new method which integrates this analysis with the replacement of membranes, from 0% to 20% per year in sea water reverse osmosis desalination plants, to reduce the carbon footprint and ecological footprint. If it is considered a replacement of 20% of the elements per year, the carbon footprint could be reduced to between 5% and 6% and even more if it is introduced low energy consumption membranes instead of high rejection elements. The factor mix in Canary Islands, according to the technological structure of the generation park that uses oil products, is around 0.678 kgCO2 /kWh, much higher than in the Spanish mainland where it is 0.263 kgCO2 /kWh. Therefore, it is estimated in Canary Islands 5,326,963 t CO2 /year can be emitted, which represents 2.4 tCO2 /person/year, 12 times more the admissible admissions per inhabitant in the Canary Islands, only considering the seawater desalination sector. This document shows the different results of the analysis of energy efficiency and the environmental footprints. This study may serve as a tool for the decision-making processes related to how to improve energy efficiency in desalination plants. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is still a need for a deeper understanding of the reasons behind these attitudes and for research based on results from more than one country. This study empirically examines a range of psychosocial and demographic determinants of support for climate policy (renewable energy, energy efficiency and carbon tax) in Germany and Poland (n = 1969). The results show that the societies of both countries, despite significant differences in income, culture and political stance on climate change, similarly support implementation of climate policies. For both countries valid predictors of support are: awareness, emotional response to climate crisis, sense of control, and belief in effectiveness of solutions; the study also shows predictors relevant in only one country. Factor analysis identified similar dimensions of attitudes toward climate change in both countries. The main findings show that support for climate policy is high in both countries and that the public is ready to accept more ambitious climate goals. Despite the differences between the countries, a coherent climate policy seems justified. The study also shows differences between the countries and provides recommendations for policymakers. © 2021 by the author.

As greenhouse-gas emissions in the atmosphere are increasing, the temperature is also rising due to the greenhouse effect. The average global temperature is increasing continuously and is predicted to rise by 2◦ C until 2100, which would cause substantial economic losses at the global level. The concentration of CO2, which accounts for a major proportion of greenhouse gases, is increasing at an alarming rate, and has led to higher growth and plant productivity due to increased photo-synthesis, but increased temperature offsets this effect as it leads to increased crop respiration rate and evapotranspiration, higher pest infestation, a shift in weed flora, and reduced crop duration. Climate change also affects the microbial population and their enzymatic activities in soil. This paper reviews the information collected through the literature regarding the issue of climate change, its possible causes, its projection in the near future, its impact on the agriculture sector as an influence on physiological and metabolic activities of plants, and its potential and reported implications for growth and plant productivity, pest infestation, and mitigation strategies and their economic impact. © 2021 by the authors.

We evaluate the system's environmental performance through high-fidelity process simulations and detailed life cycle assessment. Techno-economic analysis results show that the payback time of the waste respirator processing system is seven years with an internal rate of return of 21.5%.

Cooling actions, especially air conditioning, receive increasing scrutiny in social science, as does engagement and communication on behaviours spanning adaptation and mitigation. In response, this paper evaluates the relation between residents’ adaptation and mitigation behaviours around cooling in Fukuoka, Japan, and draws lessons for communication on encouraging adaptation and mitigation actions. A survey distributed to residents in six areas of Fukuoka, Japan, assessed perceptions of global warming and urban heat island effects, frequency of mitigation and adaptation behaviours, use of air conditioning, electricity bills and evaluation of green spaces. We observe a difference between respondents using air conditioning with an energy-saving (i.e. mitigation) focus, versus those using air conditioning with an adaptation (i.e. cooling) focus. We also note residents emphasising mitigation behaviours may use shade in parks or cooling centres as alternative cooling strategies, but that awareness of effective air conditioning use may be lacking. Our findings build on existing literature by reinforcing – in a subtropical context – the need to reconsider practices around air conditioner use; and illustrate the value of a breadth of messages to promote joint mitigation and adaptation actions. © 2020 The Authors","Air conditioning; Climate change communication; Cooling behaviours; Urban climate change; Urban heat island","Air conditioning; Atmospheric temperature; Energy conservation; Global warming; Thermal pollution; Air conditioner use; City-dwellers; Cooling strategy; Electricity bill; Fukuoka , Japan; Green spaces; Urban Heat Island Effects; Warming climate; Behavioral research","Kondo, K.; 4-9-1 Shiobaru Minami-KuJapan; email: kondo@design.kyushu-u.ac.jp",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097097423

However, there has been limited analysis of the extent to which urban planning policy documents addresses climate change adaptation and or mitigation. There is a need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions to limit warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by 2100, and to be well adapted to this change (in line with the Paris Agreement). Achieving this goal will assist in limiting damage and loss to humans and the natural environment. This paper presents a detailed qualitative and quantitative evaluation of urban planning documents (policy, regulation and law) in the state of Victoria, Australia, and the degree to which climate change mitigation and adaptation (with a focus on sea level rise) are addressed and integrated. Two scales of government (state and local) were analysed across three policy disciplines (urban planning, climate change and flood management). The evaluation framework contributes to the few tools for analyzing legislation, regulation and strategic policies for climate change adequacy. The findings reveal limited climate change adaptation and mitigation actions in urban planning documents. Additionally, there is limited integration of adaptation and mitigation actions. Important opportunities for better alignment of policies across disciplines and government levels in line Paris Agreement goals are identified, to ensure implementation in decisions made about land use and development. The analysis finds that urban planning policy must do more to include and integrate climate change adaptation and mitigation actions. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Government; Integration; Mitigation; Policy; Sea level rise; Urban planning","climate change; government; integrated approach; mitigation; sea level change; urban planning; urban policy; Australia; Victoria [Australia]","Hurlimann, A.; Faculty of Architecture Building and Planning, Australia; email: anna.hurlimann@unimelb.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096863307

The light duty vehicle (LDV) sub-sector, in particular, has experienced a substantial growth in recent years without showing signs of slowing down. Regulations coupled with incentives that make alternate-powertrain vehicles more attractive financially, have become a key policy to keep emissions from this sector in check. This study begins by determining the share of LDV emissions in each of Iran's national and international emission regulation commitments. LDV and population numbers for the country are derived up to 2050. Nine scenarios are defined to substitute the national fleet with optimum cars of alternate powertrains. These fleets are then evaluated against existing targets for each decade up to 2050. The results of this work show that the targets set for the years 2020 and 2030 are rather easy to achieve.

There is an increasing demand for CCS sites. Nevertheless, there is a lack of knowledge of the environmental risk associated with potential leakage of CO2 from the storage sites; and even more, what happens when the seepage stops. Can the environment return to the initial equilibrium? Potential effects on native macrofauna were studied under a scenario of a 50-day CO2 leakage, and the subsequent leak closure. To accomplish the objective, Trondheim Fjord sediments and clams were exposed to an acidified environment (pH 6.9) at 29 atm for 7 weeks followed by a 14-day recovery at normal seawater conditions (pH 8.0, 29 atm). Growth and survival of clams exposed to pressure (29 atm) and reduced pH (6.9) did not significantly differ from control clams kept at 1 atm in natural seawater. Furthermore, bioaccumulation of elements in the soft tissue of clams did not register significant variations for most of the analysed elements (Cd, Cr, Pb, and Ti), while other elements (As, Cu, Fe, Ni) had decreasing concentrations in tissues under acidified conditions in contrast to Na and Mg, which registered an uptake (Ku) of 111 and 9.92 μg g−1dw d−1, respectively. This Ku may be altered due to the stress induced by acidification; and the element concentration being released from sediments was not highly affected at that pH. Therefore, a 1 unit drop in pH at the seafloor for several weeks does not appear to pose a risk for the clams. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Astarte sp.; Carbon capture storage risks; CO2 impacts; Metal bioaccumulation; Shell growth rate","Biochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Molluscs; Seawater; Shellfish; Tissue; Tissue engineering; Acidified conditions; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Element concentrations; Environmental risks; Initial equilibriums; Mitigation strategy; Sub-seabed storages; Carbon capture; cadmium; calcium ion; carbon dioxide; chromium; cuprous ion; iron; lead; magnesium ion; nickel; sea water; sodium ion; titanium; zinc ion; carbon dioxide; acidification; bioaccumulation; carbon dioxide; climate change; environmental risk; fjord; global warming; leakage; mitigation; seafloor; seawater; seepage; acidification; animal experiment; animal tissue; aquatic environment; Article; astarte; atmospheric pressure; bioaccumulation; bivalve; carbon capture and storage; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; chemical environment; clam; climate change; concentration process; controlled study; environmental factor; growth rate; macrofauna; mortality rate; nonhuman; Norwegian Sea; pH; risk assessment; sediment; soft tissue; survival rate; analysis; animal; bivalve; climate change; toxicity; water pollutant; Arctic Ocean; Norway; Norwegian Sea; Trondheimsfjorden; Astarte; Bivalvia; Animals; Bivalvia; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Geologic Sediments; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Seawater; Water Pollutants, Chemical","Bonnail, E.; Centro de Investigaciones Costeras-Universidad de Atacama (CIC-UDA).

After analyzing with a dummy for the treated countries, it was confirmed that the outcome covariates: rescon (renewable energy sources consumption), population, FDI, CO2, inflation, technical corporation grants, domestic credit to the private sector, and research and development are very significant in promoting green financing and climate change mitigation in the study countries. The probit regression results give a different outcome, as rescon, FID, CO2, Human Development Index (HDI), and investment in the energy sector by the private sector that will likely have an impact on the green financing and climate change mitigation of the study countries. Furthermore, after matching the analysis through the nearest neighbor matching, kernel matching, and radius matching, it produced mixed results for both the treated and the untreated countries.

In Norway, the dairy-beef sector, in particular, has been targeted for considerable emission cuts. Despite publicly expressed interest within the agricultural sector for reducing emissions, significant measures have yet to be implemented. In this paper, we draw on qualitative data from Norway when examining the extent the wider agri-food network around farmers promotes or restrains the transition toward low-emission agricultural production. A qualitative analysis based on interviews with key stakeholders from various parts of the agri-food network of dairy-beef indicates that, if it is up to the dairy-beef system itself, it will develop in the direction of continued increased production volumes and increased efficiency in production, combined with moderate measures to reduce emissions. There is an obvious reluctance to stimulate the consumer demand toward other products or meat products with reduced emissions because such a solution would complicate full exploitation of existing agricultural resources and hence could bring considerable negative economic consequences. Another factor limiting the scope and drive towards a low-carbon production is that the effects of various potential climate measures do not appear as unambiguous. Our study indicates that the dairy-beef sector will likely not reach the goal of reduced emissions from its own initiatives. Rather, significant changes would probably require both push and pull support from forces outside the agricultural system. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Agri-food networks; Agriculture; Climate mitigation; Dairy-beef; Lock-in",,"Farstad, M.; Ruralis – Institute for Rural and Regional Research, Norway; email: maja.farstad@ruralis.no",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",0889048X,,,,"English","Agric.

Bangladesh recently formulated some policies and initiatives for reducing GHG emissions that have been increasing at an alarming rate lately, which are driven largely by economic growth, energy security, and local environmental concerns. However, little is known about the impacts of the existing policies and initiatives on curbing GHG emissions and promoting environmental sustainability, especially from the agriculture and energy sectors that contribute 44% and 39% to the country’s net emissions, respectively. This study, therefore, reviews the extent of GHG emissions in the country and analyzes the country’s key policies and initiatives for mitigating climate change and promoting environmental sustainability. The key finding is that despite the existence of a national energy policy and initiatives such as RE development, rational and efficient use of energy, Intended Nationally Determined Contributions, clean development mechanism, international and private sector collaboration, GHG emissions are projected to continue to grow at high rates due to population growth, industrialization, energy consumption growth that outpace government initiatives to reduce emission levels. The paper concludes that good governance, behavioral transformation, and public awareness about climate change are vital steps for reducing GHG emissions and promoting environmental sustainability. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon trading; Clean development mechanism; Greenhouse gas emissions; Renewable energy; Solar home systems","alternative energy; climate change; energy policy; government; greenhouse gas; population growth; private sector; sustainability; Bangladesh","Rahman, S.M.; Center for Environment and Water, KFUPM Box 713, Saudi Arabia; email: smrahman@kfupm.edu.sa",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

Encompassing European Union (EU) countries, the objective of this paper was to analyse how economic development and Hofstede's cultural dimensions contributed to climate change concerns, personal responsibility, and actions related to climate change mitigation. Furthermore, considering that actions related to climate change mitigation have different costs and benefits, in this study, we aimed to reveal whether climate change concerns and personal responsibility equally influenced all actions related to climate change mitigation and whether all types of actions were guided by the same goals. The results showed that the performance of actions related to climate change mitigation varied across European countries. The largest share of respondents declared that they reduce waste and regularly separate it for recycling. Meanwhile, a smaller share of people noted that they perform very high-cost actions such as the purchase of low-energy homes and electric cars. Economic development level significantly affects the assumption of personal responsibility and the number of actions related to climate change mitigation but not climate change concerns. Hofstede's cultural dimensions influence climate change concerns, responsibility, and the number of actions differently. Considering separate actions related to climate change mitigation, the assumption of personal responsibility significantly and positively influenced almost all actions. Climate change concerns positively and significantly affected only low-cost actions. Because of the different costs and guiding goals, the respondents who performed one action did not necessarily perform other actions related to climate change mitigation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate change concern; Climate change policy; Cost of behaviour; Pro-environmental behaviour; Responsibility","Costs; Economic and social effects; Purchasing; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Costs and benefits; Cultural analysis; European Countries; European Union countries; Hofstede's cultural dimensions; Personal responsibility; Climate change","Jakučionytė-Skodienė, M.; Department of Environmental Sciences, Studentų Str. 11, Akademija, Kaunas Dist., Lithuania; email: migle.jakucionyte@stud.vdu.lt",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

As crop and plant growth are significantly hampered under acidic soil conditions, many farmers, but increasingly as well forest managers, apply lime to raise the soil pH. Besides its direct effect on soil pH, liming also affects soil C and nutrient cycles and associated greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes. In this meta-analysis, we reviewed 1570 observations reported in 121 field-based studies worldwide, to assess liming effects on soil GHG fluxes and plant productivity. We found that liming significantly increases crop yield by 36.3%. Also, soil organic C (SOC) stocks were found to increase by 4.51% annually, though soil respiration is stimulated too (7.57%). Moreover, liming was found to reduce soil N2O emission by 21.3%, yield-scaled N2O emission by 21.5%, and CH4 emission and yield-scaled CH4 emission from rice paddies by 19.0% and 12.4%, respectively. Assuming that all acid agricultural soils are limed periodically, liming results in a total GHG balance benefit of 633−749 Tg CO2-eq year−1 due to reductions in soil N2O emissions (0.60−0.67 Tg N2O-N year−1) and paddy soil CH4 emissions (1.75−2.21 Tg CH4 year−1) and increases in SOC stocks (65.7–110 Tg C year−1). However, this comes at the cost of an additional CO2 release (c. 624–656 Tg CO2 year−1) deriving from lime mining, transport and application, and lime dissolution, so that the overall GHG balance is likely neutral. Nevertheless, liming of acid agricultural soils will increase yields by at least 6.64 × 108 Mg year−1, covering the food supply of 876 million people. Overall, our study shows for the first time that a general strategy of liming of acid agricultural soils is likely to result in an increasing sustainability of global agricultural production, indicating the potential benefit of liming acid soils for climate change mitigation and food security. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","crop yield; greenhouse gas emissions; liming; meta-analysis; soil acidification; soil organic C; soil pH",,"Yao, Z.; State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Boundary Layer Physics and Atmospheric Chemistry, China; email: zhishengyao@mail.iap.ac.cn",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13541013,,,,"English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104065650

The findings indicate a broad opinion by farmers of the effects of climate change due to the gradual increase in temperature that causes changes in the bimodal system and intensity of rainfall; reduction in agricultural and livestock production, product quality and quantity; intensification of pest and disease attacks; reduction in water sources and water quality; extinction and migration of species of flora and fauna; and effects on the family’s comfort during work and rest hours, health and hygiene.

Therefore, this study highlights the potential of retrofitting the existing rural house utilizing pervasive construction technologies in diminishing energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions as a climate change mitigation strategy. The current modern rural house and the construction typologies were characterized. This study selected a typical modern rural dwelling located in Al-Gharbia Governorate in the Delta region. The suggested retrofitting strategies were applied to the external building envelope. The impact on the annual energy consumption of cooling and heating loads was evaluated using an Energy Performance Assessment Tool (Design Builder). An optimal envelope configuration was suggested, then an economic assessment and an investigation to the local acceptance were provided. The results showed that using the commonly used construction techniques as a retrofitting strategy can plummet the energy consumption and CO2 emissions by one-third worthy of mentioning that the locals have shown a lack of interest in the investment in retrofitting their buildings as well as the economic model showed that the investment is not profitable.

In the context of flood mitigation, however, it remains unclear to which degree loss dynamics can be attributed to these causes. We addressed this question based on a record of approximately 12,000 events covering the period between 1962 and 2017, a database containing roughly 120,000 mitigation structures, an inventory of the building stock and 15 climate indices related to hazard triggering conditions. While the indices of triggering precipitation and the number of exposed buildings increased steadily, frequency, magnitude and seasonality of damage-inducing torrential flooding did not show clear trends. This contradiction was attributed to a compensatory effect of the increasing number of technical mitigation structures.

Women, forming a major portion of the world poor and having less education and resources to manage climate risks, are more vulnerable to adverse effects of climate change as compared to men. Due to many social, cultural and religious norms restricting the mobility of women, women are greatly affected by climate-induced agricultural and biodiversity losses, climate-related wars, natural disasters and migrations. Despite of having close relationship with environment and natural resources, women’s representation in climate decisions is very less and their role is seldom appreciated. The current study sheds light on different scenarios of climate change including agriculture, biodiversity, water, natural disasters, wars, migration, pollution, health and sanitation, education, disempowerment, security, social and psychological effects and human rights in relation to women’s vulnerability to it.

This paper provides a short global overview of the energy-intensity of various forms of accommodation establishments, with a more focused discussion of energy-use in Austria, including different types of end-uses. The paper concludes that the accommodation sector is, in comparison to transportation, already a low-carbon sector, and has a good potential to fully decarbonize until 2040. The paper analyses carbon management needs in businesses, as well as the role and importance of policies and legislation to accelerate decarbonization. This paper has an applied nature and is part of the Austrian Special Report on Climate Change. Management Implications: • Most accommodation establishments still waste energy. Yet, interest in saving energy is often limited due to the (perceived) low cost of energy. • A switch to renewable electricity use (sun, wind, water) as well as other renewable energies (wood, biogas) is only marginally more expensive than using conventional (fossil) energy. • Energy consulting, incentive programs, as well as energy-related legislation can also increase the interest of owners and managers to engage in energy savings. • For new buildings, architecture and design can support energy savings. Passive energy standards, passive solar heating, passive cooling, as well as smaller guest rooms or public areas reduce heating and cooling cost. Compact designs also reduce staff and operational cost. • Additional reductions in CO2 emissions can result out of greater awareness of energy use, and concomitant changes in service designs (e.g., food, wellness, transport). • Information on climate-friendliness in marketing materials and reservation platforms involves guests, influences their choices, and serves as an incentive for further low-carbon investments. • Staff training in energy-management and low-carbon operations can make significant contributions to operational energy savings, and is often paramount for the implementation of measures. © 2021 The Author(s)","Accommodation; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Renewable energy",,"Lund-Durlacher, D.; Department of Tourism and Service Management, Am Kahlenberg 1, Austria; email: dagmar.lund-durlacher@modul.ac.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",22130780,,,,"English","J.

Here, we analyze whether newspapers in developing countries frame climate action as an adaptation or mitigation issue. Mitigation refers to activities to reduce or prevent carbon emissions whereas adaptation refers to activities to adjust economic and social systems to the effects of climate change. To this end, we conduct a comparative quantitative analysis of climate change news framing in newspapers from two carbon locked-in developing countries: Nigeria and Turkey. Our first research question is whether newspapers in the two countries frame climate change as a mitigation or adaptation issue. Our second research question is whether there is a relationship between the use of foreign sources and the use of a mitigation frame. We find more adaptation framing in Nigerian newspapers whereas adaptation and mitigation frames are more evenly seen in Turkish newspapers. We also find that the use of foreign sources in news with a climate action frame is negatively correlated with the use of an adaptation frame in our sample.

However, so far, little is known about the relationship between Muslim communities and climate change. Globally, Muslims constitute the second largest faith group, and there is a strong concentration of Muslims in regions that are particularly affected by global warming. This review synthesizes existing research about climate change and Muslim communities. It addresses (a) Islamic environmentalism, (b) Muslim perceptions of climate change, and (c) mitigation strategies of Muslim communities. The analysis shows that there is no uniform interpretation of climate change among Muslims. Based on their interpretations of Islam, Muslims have generated different approaches to climate change. A small section of Muslim environmentalists engages in public campaigning to raise greater concern about climate change, seeks to reduce carbon emissions through sociotechnological transition efforts, and disseminates proenvironmental interpretations of Islam. However, it remains unclear to what extent these activities generate broader changes in the daily activities of Muslim communities and organizations. Contributions to this research field are often theoretical and stress theological and normative aspects of Islam. Empirical studies have particularly addressed Indonesia and the United Kingdom, whereas knowledge about Muslim climate activism in other world regions is fragmented. Against this backdrop, there is a need for comparative studies that consider regional and religious differences among Muslims and address the role of Muslim environmentalism in climate change mitigation and adaptation at the international, national, and local scales.

With a moderate growth of steel production, the introduction of BAT enables stabilization of total emissions at about the current level. Under conditions of accelerated growth of steel production, total CO2 emissions increase even with the introduction of BAT.

Compared to conventional hydrothermal catalysis, electrocatalysis possesses the advantage of mild operational conditions and high selectivity, yet the potential energy savings and climate change mitigation have rarely been assessed. This study conducted a life cycle assessment (LCA) for the electrocatalytic oxidation of crude glycerol to produce lactic acid, one of the most common platform chemicals. The LCA results demonstrated a 31% reduction in global warming potential (GWP) compared to the benchmark (bio- A nd chemocatalytic) processes. Additionally, electrocatalysis yielded a synergetic potential to mitigate climate change depending on the scenario. For example, electrocatalysis combined with a low-carbon-intensity grid can reduce GWP by 57% if the process yields lactic acid and lignocellulosic biofuel as compared to a conventional fossil-based system with functionally equivalent products. This illustrates the potential of electrocatalysis as an important contributor to climate change mitigation across multiple industries. A technoeconomic analysis (TEA) for electrocatalytic lactic acid production indicated considerable challenges in economic feasibility due to the significant upfront capital cost. This challenge could be largely addressed by enabling dual redox processing to produce separate streams of renewable chemicals and biofuels simultaneously. © XXXX American Chemical Society.",,"Artificial life; Biofuels; Catalysis; Cellulosic ethanol; Consumer products; Costs; Electrocatalysis; Energy conservation; Global warming; Lactic acid; Life cycle; Lignocellulosic biomass; Potential energy; Tea; Climate change mitigation; Economic feasibilities; Electro-catalytic oxidation; Global warming potential; Lactic acid production; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Operational conditions; Techno-Economic analysis; Coal industry","Lam, C.H.; State Key Laboratory of Marine Pollution, Hong Kong; email: jason.lam@cityu.edu.hk",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"33577303","English","Environ.

The 3 M management concept now changed into a 4 M management concept that includes energy management. In the case of energy management, the electrical energy sector assumes critical importance. An energy cost occupies nearly 30-40% of the production cost in small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) has initiated a separate energy efficiency intervention to the SME's, where the energy-efficient technologies, operational procedures, and proper awareness programs to SMEs are stated. This paper discusses the complete electrical energy audit on a small-scale Siddha and Ayurveda medicine industry. The traditional medicine manufacturing technologies make the process complex (process loads are intermittent/interlinked) during analysis. Hence, the detailed energy auditing/conservation studies on the power factor/harmonics were carried out without affecting Indian traditional medicine manufacturing technology. The postauditing design and installation of an intelligent controller by considering the intermittent/interlinked loads are carried out, and the effectiveness of the intelligent controller is ascertained with the energy conservation and the carbon emission reduction of SME. In addition, the climate change mitigation is ensured through the design and deployment of grid-interactive rooftop solar photovoltaic power plant using Solar Pro v4.5 (Photovoltaic System simulation software) with the power analysis, economic analysis and life cycle carbon emission of the proposed plant. The proposed solar photovoltaic power plant ensures energy self-sufficiency and sustainable energy utilization by carbon emission reduction on electricity utilization of SMEs. © 2021 G. N.

Understanding soil organic carbon (SOC) storage and the factors influencing SOC in coffee plantations are necessary for the development of sound land management practices to prevent land degradation and minimize SOC losses. This study was conducted in the main coffee-growing regions of Yunnan; SOC concentrations and storage of shaded and unshaded coffee systems were assessed in the top 40 cm of soil. Relationships between SOC concentration and factors affecting SOC were analysed using multiple linear regression based on the forward and backward stepwise regression method. Factors analysed were soil bulk density (ρb), soil pH, total nitrogen of soil (N), mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual moisture (MAM), mean annual precipitation (MAP) and elevations (E). Akaike's information criterion (AIC), coefficient of determination (R2), root mean square error (RMSE) and residual sum of squares (RSS) were used to describe the accuracy of multiple linear regression models. Results showed that mean SOC concentration and storage decreased significantly with depth under unshaded coffee systems. Mean SOC concentration and storage were higher in shaded than unshaded coffee systems at 20-40 cm depth. The correlations between SOC concentration and ρb, pH and N were significant. Evidence from the multiple linear regression model showed that soil bulk density (ρb), soil pH, total nitrogen of soil (N) and climatic variables had the greatest impact on soil carbon storage in the coffee system.

In many nations, this global epidemic has affected lives, property, and financial damage. Pakistan has experienced many floods in the past several years. Due to economic, social, and climate change, Pakistan is at risk of flooding. In order to overcome this problem, the institutions of the country have taken various measures. However, these measures are not sufficient enough to ensure the safety of communities and areas that are prone to disasters with a rapid onset. Hence, it is imperative to forecast future flood-related risks and take necessary measures to mitigate the adverse impacts and losses caused by floods. This article is aimed at exploring floods in Pakistan, analyze the adverse effects of floods on humans and the environment, and propose possible sustainable options for the future. The aqueduct flood analyzer software was used to examine the impact of floods on gross domestic product (GDP), urban damage, and people livelihood, with several years of flood protection plans. To adequately assess the future changes, various flood protection levels and three scenarios for each level of protection were employed, which represent the socio-economic and climate change. The findings revealed that if there is no flood protection, a 2-year flood has a 50% probability of flood occurrence in any given area and may cause no significant impact on GDP, population, and urban damage. Similarly, the probability of a flood occurrence in a five-year flood is 20%, which may cause the country’s GDP about $20.4 billion, with 8.4 million population at risk and $1.4 billion urban damage. Furthermore, a 10-year flood has a 10% probability of flood occurrence and may affect the national GDP by $28.9 billion, with 11.9 million affected population and $2.4 billion urban damage in Pakistan. The government of Pakistan should devise appropriate climate change policies, improve disaster preparedness, build new dams, and update relevant departments to mitigate the adverse effects of flooding. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Flood protection; Flood risks management; Gross domestic product (GDP); Impact assessment; Sustainable development; Urban damage",,"Khan, I.; College of Economics & Management, 3 Taicheng Road, China; email: imran@aup.edu.pk",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",09441344,,ESPLE,,"English","Environ.

Pastoralists are higher vulnerable to these climate shocks and livestock major source of their nutrition and income. This research work focused to analyze the factors affecting resilience of pastoral community in Punjab province of Pakistan. Understanding shocks of climate change in historical perspective of pastoral community, consultation for key information, and focus group discussions were managed. The study collected data of 768 pastoral households’ regarding pastoral shocks experience, long-term adaptation measures, and coping strategies through external support for resilience upright. Principal component analysis was used for construction of resilience index of pastoral households. In estimating institutional factors, adaptive practice and socio-demographic effects on pastoral households’ resilience structured probit regression were employed in the study. Extension services access, availability of adequate formal credit, pastoral household income, schooling years and adaptive practice like afforestation, the practice of ethno-veterinary, improved stock breeding, beekeeping, enclosures, and grazing of crop fields post-harvest affect significantly and positively in developing pastoral household resilience to shocks. In the past scenario long-term adaptation strategies, policy measures ignored, while investment priority was focused on risk-reducing measures.

Many assume temporal independence—that abatement costs in one period are not affected by prior abatement. We contrast this with three dimensions of dynamic realism in emitting systems: (i) inertia, (ii) induced innovation, and (iii) path dependence. We review key evidence from the last quarter century on each of these three components. Studies of stock lifetime, dynamics of diffusion and past transitions suggest typical transition timescales of at least 20–40 years for the bulk emitting systems. The evidence that substantial innovation is induced by both prices and market deployment is unambiguous. Finally, both data and a rapidly growing literature demonstrate substantial path dependence in general, and specifically “carbon lock-in and lock-out.” Some stylized models in the past decade have incorporated technology learning, and others have considered inertia, but the combination of these factors is important and not yet evident. More complex hybrid IAMs with technology-rich energy-system models incorporate these factors, but their complexity has limited the wider understanding and influence of their underlying insights. Few if any global models fully represent path dependence. We conclude with likely implications drawing upon the empirical and modeling evidence accumulated, including results from extending DICE with a highly stylized representation of such dynamic factors. This suggests that dynamic interdependencies could multiply several-fold the optimal level of initial abatement expenditure. This is because early abatement then also directly facilitates subsequent emission savings. The diversity of dynamic linkages across sectors and technologies also implies more nuanced policy than a single global carbon price. Thus, the issues explored in this review can radically change the general policy conclusions drawn from models, which, like DICE, neglect dynamic realism.

One of the action plans has been to promote afforestation and reforestation in non-forested lands for carbon sequestration. Thus, this paper aims to address the forest resources in Taiwan by using the latest national survey, reporting on an interactive analysis of forest carbon sequestration, GHG emissions, and climate-change mitigation policies. In this regard, the methodology is based on the official websites of forest resources, GHG emissions, and carbon sequestration from the yearbooks, national statistics, and regulations relevant to the mitigation policies in the forestry sector. It is found that Taiwan’s forest area is estimated to be 2.197 million hectares, which corresponds to a total forest stock volume of about 502.0 million cubic meters. During the period of 1990-2018, the change in total carbon sequestration did not vary much (with the exception of 2009), decreasing from 23.4 million metric tons in 1990 to 21.4 million metric tons in 2018. Compared to the total carbon dioxide emissions (i.e., 102.4 million metric tons in 1990 and 282.8 million metric tons in 2018), the contribution to GHG mitigation in the forestry sector shows a declining trend. However, biomass (i.e., wood) carbon sequestration indicates a slight increase from 20.4 million metric tons in 2010 to 20.7 million metric tons in 2018 due to the afforestation policy. Obviously, regulatory policies, based on the Forestry Act and the Greenhouse Gas Reduction & Management Act in 2015, play a vital role in mitigating GHG emissions in Taiwan. The discussion on the regulations is further addressed to highlight climate-change mitigation policies in Taiwan’s forestry sector. © 2020 by the authors.

A total of 370 people from two Mexican cities took part in the research. The findings, processed by a structural equations model, show that beliefs regarding CC influence coping responses and intention to act, which in turn positively impact mitigation behaviours in response to CC.

Hence, the cement industry is currently under pressure to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions. Climate change mitigation strategies implemented in the industry leads to GHGs reduction, climate risks, pollutants, and another adverse impact on the environment. In order to implement climate change mitigation strategies in the cement industry, a careful analysis of barriers that hinder the emission reduction must be taken. However, most existing research on the barriers to mitigation measures is focused on developed countries. Among the most important emerging economies, India, the second-largest producer and consumer of cement, faces challenges to implement emission reduction measures. To bridge this gap, this paper identifies and evaluates the barriers and solutions to overcome these barriers in the context of India. This study employs a three-phase methodology based on fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (AHP) and fuzzy technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to identify barriers and solutions to overcome these barriers to climate change mitigation strategies adoption in Indian cement industry. Fuzzy AHP is employed to prioritize these barriers, and to rank solutions of these barriers, Fuzzy TOPSIS is employed. Ten Indian cement manufacturing industry is taken to illustrate the proposed three-phase methodology. Finally, the result of the analysis offers an effective decision support tool to the Indian cement industry to eliminate and overcome barriers to mitigation strategies adoption and build their green image in the market.

In 2011, heavy rain of 110.5 mm/hr caused great damage to the Seoul Metropolitan Government. Most of the causes of flooding in modern cities include a sharp increase in non-permeable pavement and a lack of water circulation facilities. It is predicted that heavy rainfalls will occur in the future, causing large amounts of local damage. In this study, possible future flood damages were analyzed using climate change scenarios based on the Korean Peninsula. ArcGIS was adopted to perform analyses, and Huff curves were employed for precipitation analysis. Water tanks, permeable pavement, and ecological waterways were installed as mitigation technologies. These three technologies can contribute to flooding mitigation by increasing the rainwater storage capacity. This study suggests that all floods can be reduced by RCP 8.5 by 2050 and 2060. Although there will be run-off after 2050, it is believed that technology will significantly reduce the volume and possibility of floods. It is recommended that a one-year analysis should be conducted in consideration of the maintenance aspects that will arise in the future. © 2020 by the authors.

Particularly in regions that are massively affected by climatic changes, such as the Pacific Island States, there is a need for increased and combined research on the role which these knowledge systems can play internationally. For this reason, this article provides a synthesis of empirical results and approaches to local and Indigenous climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in selected South Pacific Island States by using a meta-ethnographic approach. The reviewed literature is associated with the sub-disciplinary perspective of the Anthropology of Climate Change. The results of the meta-ethnographic analysis are discussed based on three thematic focal points: First, the empirical ground of local understandings of climate change and its theoretical conceptualization(s) are constituted. Second, the results of practices for adaptation to climate change are synthesized and presented in detail throughout one example. Third, the synthesis of climate change mitigation practices is outlined with a specific focus on human-environment relationships. © 2020 by the author.

The three steps in the modeling process are: (1) generation of the data sets with a detailed simulation model; (2) estimation of the system models from the data; (3) application of the obtained dynamic economic optimization model considering inorganic and organic fertilizer inputs. We demonstrate the approach with a case study: barley production in southern Finland on coarse and clay soils. Our results show that there is a synergy between climate change mitigation and water protection goals, and a trade-off between pollution mitigation and crop production goals. If a field is a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and an insignificant source of water pollution, atmospheric externalities dominate the water externalities, even for a relatively low social cost of carbon (SCC). If a field is a significant source of water pollution, the SCC would have to be very high before atmospheric externalities dominate water externalities. In addition, an integrated nutrient management system appears better than a system in which only inorganic or organic fertilizer is used, although manure is not a solution to agriculture's GHG emissions problem. Moreover, GHG emissions and nitrogen and carbon leaching mitigation efforts should first be targeted at coarse soils rather than clay soils, because the marginal abatement costs are considerably lower for coarse soils. © 2020","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Crop production; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Water pollution","climate change; crop production; fertilizer application; leaching; pollutant source; trade-off; water pollution; Finland; Hordeum","Sihvonen, M.; University of HelsinkiFinland; email: matti.sihvonen@helsinki.fi",,"Elsevier Ltd",0308521X,,AGSYD,,"English","Agric.

To better understand consumers’ preferences and attitudes towards a carbon neutral label on globally traded agri-food products, the willingness to pay (WTP) of German consumers for a carbon neutral label on specialty coffee was examined. A discrete choice experiment was conducted in Germany, where coffee is often sold with multiple labels or claims, in order to examine the WTP for alternative combinations of a carbon neutral label with either a Fair Trade label or a claim of direct trade coffee sourcing. Choice data were analyzed using random parameter logit models which determined a positive WTP for the carbon neutral label. This estimate exceeds the corresponding marginal costs of certification and the marginal social cost of carbon, yet it is relatively lower than the estimated WTP for the Fair Trade label and the direct trade claim. A positive synergy effect on utility was also determined for the combination of a carbon neutral label and a direct trade claim. If no additional information was provided, consumers often perceived coffee as a “natural product” that does not generate any greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, awareness-building policies are needed to make carbon neutral labels an effective market-based tool to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the agri-food sector. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agri-food sector; Carbon neutral label; Certification; Climate change mitigation; Coffee value chain; Willingness to pay","Carbon footprint; Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Food products; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Logistic regression; Climate change mitigation; Discrete choice experiments; Market-based approach; Multiple labels; Natural products; Random parameters; Social cost of carbon; Willingness to pay; Commerce","Birkenberg, A.; Division of Social and Institutional Change in Agricultural Development, Wollgrasweg 43, Germany; email: A.Birkenberg@uni-hohenheim.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

There is a vicious cycle that makes agriculture both a victim (because of negative effects of Global Warming on food supply) and a perpetrator (one of the main causes of Climatic Change). Producing more food for a starving world, agriculture requires large inputs, such as high amounts of nitrogen-based fertilisers, which in turn releases nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, one of the Greenhouse gases. Carbon dioxide, an important Greenhouse gas, for instance, can be beneficious for some vegetable species. There are other impacts of climate change in vegetable production, not only in plant physiology. Plant and fruit quality are affected by elevated temperatures; affect pollination and fruit set. There are other impacts on vegetable production systems, for instance, extended growing season because of warmer springs and autumns, but also new zones will be incorporated to vegetable production, where before it was impossible to produce larger amounts of quality vegetable for temperature. Mitigation of climate change is not an easy task; it involves many actors all over the science spectrum and government policies, but mainly the people conscience. Breeders may do huge efforts to generate varieties tolerant to many stresses. A challenge is to generate varieties tolerant to high temperature stress and low input production, with high rusticity and able to respond to biotic and abiotic stresses caused by Climate Change. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.","Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Production; Vegetables",,"Saavedra, G.; Vegetables Department, Km 10 Camino Cajón, Chile; email: gsaavedr@inia.cl",,"Springer",21984182,,,,"English","Stud.

Acknowledging this, urban climate change adaptation and mitigation plans are increasingly developed to make progress toward enhancing climate resilience. While there is consensus that focusing on both adaptation and mitigation is necessary for addressing climate change impacts, better understanding of their interactions is needed to efficiently maximize their potentials. This paper, first, provides a bibliographic analysis to map existing knowledge regarding adaptation-mitigation interactions. This is done using methods such as bibliographic coupling, co-citation analysis, and co-occurrence analysis. Then, drawing on the literature, this study explores two types of interactions between adaptation and mitigation measures, namely co-benefits and synergies. These interactions are explored through analyzing evidence reported in the literature on different measures related to sectors such as energy, transportation, waste, water, green infrastructure, urban planning, and governance. Results of the bibliographic analysis show that there is a lack of research in the Global South. Results of the detailed content analysis show that many measures can provide co-benefits and synergies. Measures related to green infrastructure, buildings, energy systems, and, transportation are particularly capable of providing co-benefits. In addition, it was found that appropriate levels of density, promotion of public transportation, and urban greenery are measures that are more likely to provide synergistic benefits if combined with other adaptation and/or mitigation measures. This study highlights the need for more empirical research to better understand the magnitude of synergistic benefits between different measures. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Co-benefit; Energy; Green infrastructure; Interaction; Mitigation; Synergy","Bibliographies; Information analysis; Urban transportation; Bibliographic analysis; Bibliographic couplings; Climate change impact; Co-Citation Analysis; Co-occurrence analysis; Green infrastructure; Mitigation measures; Public transportation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; environmental planning; environmental policy; literature review; mitigation; research work; citation analysis; city planning; climate change; content analysis; drawing; empirical research; human; human experiment; review; waste water",,,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"32858298","English","Sci.

Mobilising private finance in Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries will, in turn, be of crucial importance for achieving both Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7–which calls for universal energy access–and climate change mitigation goals defined under the Paris Agreement. In this paper, we assess how UNFCCC-backed climate finance instruments have engaged private investment for energy-focused climate mitigation in SSA. Based on this assessment, we develop recommendations for public climate finance institutions. Our work builds on documentary and database analysis and interviews, as well as participatory methodologies applied at a stakeholder workshop conducted in Kampala, Uganda, in 2018. Three case studies from Ethiopia, Madagascar and South Africa illustrate how climate finance interacts with domestic policy instruments, including in relation to the Kyoto Protocol’s Clean Development Mechanism, South Africa’s domestic renewable energy auctions, and the Green Climate Fund. The paper finds that there is no ‘catch all’ success model and approaches need to be tailored to local circumstances. Key policy insights International market mechanisms and climate finance can be key catalysts for private multibillion-dollar investment in energy access and climate mitigation, even under the challenging conditions facing many SSA nations. Market mechanisms need to be managed well to provide the private sector with the certainty needed to commit to fresh investments. A programmatic approach with standardised baseline and monitoring methodologies should be anchored in the next generation of project-based market mechanisms under Paris Agreement Article 6.

International agreements such as the Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement are the driving framework for developing policies and fostering research and innovation. However, the proportionality of technological innovation, funding, and policy development is very skewed towards energy-intensive sectors like transport, industry and energy and ignores sectors like agriculture and waste. This paper aims to explore three dimensions that drive the development of CCMT in the agriculture sector: innovation, policy and funding. We have used a mixed-method approach where we have collected open-source data, using text mining techniques for filtering CCMT and agriculture concerning regulations and projects, and applied a descriptive analysis. The findings of this study show that there is no precise alignment of the three dimensions and confirm that only 2.3% of the EU financial contribution goes to the agriculture sector. Moreover, most of the climate change policies or regulations are intended for energy-intensive sectors and not explicitly focused on agriculture. Finally, the analysis reveals that the constricted development of CCMT in the agricultural sector is not only due to the limited financial investment but also due to conflicting policies, decisions, and regulatory cooperation. © 2020 IEEE.","Agriculture; Climate change policy; EU funding; Exploratory analysis; Technological innovation","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Big data; Digital storage; Food supply; Investments; Text mining; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Descriptive analysis; Energy-intensive sectors; Financial contributions; Financial investments; Technological innovation; Text mining techniques; Climate change",,"Wu X.Jermaine C.Xiong L.Hu X.T.Kotevska O.Lu S.Xu W.Aluru S.Zhai C.Al-Masri E.Chen Z.Saltz J.","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728162515,,,"English","Proc. - IEEE Int.

The BBC can be considered a potential alternative for climate change mitigation and adaptation and developed where bamboo is an available source. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-based; Biogenic carbon; Brazil; Decarbonization of matrix; DLCA; Dynamic simulation; Future weather data; GHG emissions","Bamboo; Carbon; Concretes; Life cycle; Building envelopes; Carbon stocks; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Constructive systems; Energy simulation; Housing projects; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Climate change","Rosse Caldas, L.",,"Elsevier Ltd",09500618,,CBUME,,"English","Constr Build Mater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090207522

These plans and policies are often focused on either mitigation or adaptation. This dichotomized approach can be problematic and result in trade-offs. In other words, efforts aimed at enhancing mitigation (adaptation) may hinder achieving adaptation (mitigation) objectives. Additionally, conflicts may arise as there might be inconsistencies between some mitigation and adaptation measures. Since trade-offs and conflicts between adaptation and mitigation measures can undermine effectiveness and efficiency of municipal activities, efforts should be made to avoid or minimize them. This study aims to provide a better understanding of potential trade-offs and conflicts through reviewing literature on the interactions between urban adaptation and mitigation measures. This is done through bibliographic analysis and detailed content analyses of selected papers. Results of this review show that research on trade-offs and conflict has gained traction since the publication of the fourth assessment report of The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. However, there is still a lack of empirical studies. In particular, limited research exists on the Global South cities. Also, according to the findings, existing research is mainly focused on trade-offs associated with measures related to energy, land use, transport, water, building, green infrastructure, and waste sectors. It is found that mitigation measures may have negative impacts on adaptation by increasing exposure to risks such as the urban heat island effect and flooding and/or by eroding livelihood options of poor and marginalized groups and causing equity concerns. In contrast, adaptation measures may increase greenhouse gas emissions by, among other things, reducing efficiency and increasing energy demand. It is discussed that integrated assessment frameworks should be utilized to deal with trade-offs and conflicts. Finally, some recommendations for better uptake of integrated frameworks are provided. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Conflict; Interaction; Mitigation; Trade-off","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Risk assessment; Adaptation to climate changes; Bibliographic analysis; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Integrated assessment; Integrated frameworks; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Municipal activities; Urban Heat Island Effects; Climate change","Sharifi, A.1-3-1 Kagamiyama, Higashi-Hiroshima City, Japan; email: sharifi@hiroshima-u.ac.jp",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Green infrastructure planning has been identified as a new and innovative means of land planning that can contribute to preventing the impacts of climate change. However, this has been explored more thoroughly in urban areas than at the regional scale. The present study proposes a methodology including multi-criteria evaluation techniques for assessing the ESS involved in the fight against climate change and for the spatial planning of multifunctional green infrastructure areas based on the results of this assessment. Application of the methodology for green infrastructure planning aimed at confronting climate change at landscape level in the region of Galicia (NW Spain) successfully delimited multifunctional green infrastructure zones.

Every day, at different places of the world, the planet sends alarming messages about the enormous transformations it is experiencing due to human-based activities. The latter are responsible for changing weather patterns that threaten food production, energy production and energy consumption, the desertification of land, the displacement of people and animals because of food and water shortages due to the reductions in rainfall, natural disasters and rising sea levels. The effects of climate change affect us all, and if drastic measures are not considered in a timely manner, it will be more difficult and costly to adapt to the aforementioned effects in the future. Considering this context, the aim of this work is to implement a prospective study/structural analysis to the identified sectors of a regional plan of adaptation to climate change so as to promote the resilience of the region against the negative phenomena generated by the climate crisis. This was achieved in two steps: first, we identified the relationships between the strategic sectors of the plan and organized them in order of importance. Second, we assessed the effectiveness of several public policies oriented towards a city’s resilience according to their impact upon the strategic sectors of the plan and the co-benefits generated by their implementation for society. The results highlight that the most essential sectors for the mitigation of climate change are flood risk management, built environment, forest ecosystem management, human health, tourism and rise in sea level. As a consequence, the most important measures for the resilience of the North Aegean Region against climate change are the ones related to the preparation of strategic master plans for flood protection projects. © 2020 by the authors.

We sought to summarize current knowledge about the potential impacts (co-benefits and co-harms) of climate mitigation policies and interventions on Indigenous health. Using a Kaupapa Māori theoretical positioning, we adapted a validated search strategy to identify studies for this scoping review. Our review included empirical and modeling studies that examined a range of climate change mitigation measures, with health-related outcomes analyzed by ethnicity or socioeconomic status. Data were extracted from published reports and summarized. We identified 36 studies that examined a diverse set of policy instruments, with the majority located in high-income countries. Most studies employed conventional Western research methodologies, and few examined potential impacts of particular relevance to Indigenous peoples. The existing body of knowledge is limited in the extent to which it can provide definitive evidence about co-benefits and co-harms for Indigenous health, with impacts highly dependent on individual policy characteristics and contextual factors. Improving the quality of evidence will require research partnerships with Indigenous communities and study designs that centralize Indigenous knowledges, values, realities and priorities. © 2020 by the authors.

In order to deliver a more straightforward message on the effect of the reduction of SLCPs to policymakers, we propose “top-down” reduction targets of CH4 and tropospheric O3 in reference to the historical levels of their RF. Although the RF increase due to the increasing CO2 concentration is inevitable in mid-term future (ca. 0.80 W m−2 in 2040), the RF of CH4 and O3 is expected to decrease from 0.48 to 0.41, 0.34, 0.27, and 0.22 W m−2, and from 0.40 to 0.29, 0.23, 0.19, and 0.15 W m−2, respectively, if their atmospheric concentrations decrease from the level of 2010 to those of 1980, 1970, 1960, and 1950, according to the IPCC 2013 database. Consequently, the sum of ΔRFx(CH4) and ΔRFx(O3) (the difference of RF between the target year of x and 2010 as the base year) are 0.18, 0.31, 0.42, and 0.51 W m−2 in 1980, 1970, 1960, and 1950, indicating that the increase of ΔRF2040(CO2) can be compensated by 23, 39, 53, and 64%, respectively. The policy target can be selected from the combination of different target years each for CH4 and O3. With this global reduction ratio, the necessary reductions in CH4, NOx, and NMVOC in Asia were estimated and compared with the GAINS model-based cost-beneficial reduction amount proposed by the Solution Report prepared under UN Environment Asia and the Pacific Office. In order to attain the targeted reduced emission level of CH4 and NOx, new technology/practice for the reduction of livestock emission of CH4 and energy transformation from fossil fuel to renewable energy is highly advantageous for NOx reduction from industrial/power plant sources.

Afforestation of degraded grassland, sometimes by using invasive alien trees, has been put forward as a legitimate climate change mitigation strategy. However, even in cases where tree encroachment of degraded grasslands leads to increased soil organic carbon, it may come at a high cost since the restoration of grassland-characteristic biodiversity and ecosystem services will be blocked. We assessed how invasion by Prosopis juliflora and restoration of degraded grasslands in a semi-arid region in Baringo, Kenya affected soil organic carbon, biodiversity and fodder availability. Thirty years of grassland restoration replenished soil organic carbon to 1 m depth at a rate of 1.4% per year and restored herbaceous biomass to levels of pristine grasslands, while plant biodiversity remained low. Invasion of degraded grasslands by P. juliflora increased soil organic carbon primarily in the upper 30 cm and suppressed herbaceous vegetation. We argue that, in contrast to encroachment by invasive alien trees, restoration of grasslands in tropical semi-arid regions can both serve as a measure for climate change mitigation and help restore key ecosystem services important for pastoralists and agro-pastoralist communities. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,"Mbaabu, P.R.; Kenya Forestry Research Institute (KEFRI), P.O.

First, they must deal with an intra-generational conflict that emerges from the allocation of costs of climate change mitigation among different actors of the current generation. Second, they face an inter-generational conflict that stems from the higher costs for long-term mitigation measures, particularly helping future generations, compared to the short-term actions aimed at adapting to the immediate effects of climate change, benefiting mostly the current generation. We devise a novel game to study this multi-level conflict and investigate individuals’ behavior in a lab experiment. We find that, although individuals reach sufficient cooperation levels to avoid adverse consequences for their own generation, they contribute more to cheaper short-term than to costlier long-term measures, to the detriment of future generations. Simple “nudge” interventions, however, may alter this pattern considerably. We find that changing the default contribution level to the inter-generational welfare optimum increases long-term contributions. Moreover, providing individuals with the possibility to commit themselves to inter-generational solidarity leads to an even stronger increase in long-term contributions. Nevertheless, the results also suggest that nudges alone may not be enough to induce inter-generationally optimal contributions. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Experiment; Inter-generational; Nudging; Social dilemma",,"Böhm, R.; Department of Psychology, Øster Farimagsgade 2a, Denmark; email: rb@psy.ku.dk",,"MDPI AG",20734336,,,,"English","Games",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092474821

Here we use results from the 33rd Energy Modeling Forum study (EMF-33) to investigate projected international bioenergy trade for different integrated assessment models across several climate change mitigation scenarios. Results show that in scenarios with no climate policy, international bioenergy trade is likely to increase over time, and becomes even more important when climate targets are set. More stringent climate targets, however, do not necessarily imply greater bioenergy trade compared to weaker targets, as final energy demand may be reduced. However, the scaling up of bioenergy trade happens sooner and at a faster rate with increasing climate target stringency. Across models, for a scenario likely to achieve a 2 °C target, 10–45 EJ/year out of a total global bioenergy consumption of 72–214 EJ/year are expected to be traded across nine world regions by 2050. While this projection is greater than the present trade volumes of coal or natural gas, it remains below the present trade of crude oil. This growth in bioenergy trade largely replaces the trade in fossil fuels (especially oil) which is projected to decrease significantly over the twenty-first century. As climate change mitigation scenarios often show diversified energy systems, in which numerous world regions can act as bioenergy suppliers, the projections do not necessarily lead to energy security concerns. Nonetheless, rapid growth in the trade of bioenergy is projected in strict climate mitigation scenarios, raising questions about infrastructure, logistics, financing options, and global standards for bioenergy production and trade. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bioenergy trade; Climate policy; EMF; Energy security; Integrated assessment models; Scenario analysis","Climate models; Commerce; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Bioenergy productions; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Climate policy; Climate targets; Energy systems; Global standards; Integrated assessment models; Climate change; assessment method; bioenergy; climate change; integrated approach; international trade; strategic approach","Daioglou, V.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable Development, Princetonlaan 8a, Netherlands; email: Vassilis.daioglou@pbl.nl",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Hence, academic and policy discourses highlight behavioral changes among households as an essential strategy for combating climate change. However, formal models used to assess economic impacts of energy policies face limitations in tracing cumulative impacts of adaptive behavior of diverse households. The past decade has witnessed a proliferation of agent-based simulation models that quantify behavioral climate change mitigation relying on social science theories and micro-level survey data. Yet, these behaviorally-rich models usually operate on a small scale of neighborhoods, towns, and small regions, ignoring macro-scale social institutions such as international markets and rarely covering large areas relevant for climate change mitigation policy. This paper presents a methodology to scale up behavioral changes among heterogeneous individuals regarding energy choices while tracing their macroeconomic and cross-sectoral impacts. To achieve this goal, we combine the strengths of top-down computable general equilibrium models and bottom-up agent-based models. We illustrate the integration process of these two alien modeling approaches by linking data-rich macroeconomic with micro-behavioral models. Following a three-step approach, we investigate the dynamics of cumulative impacts of changes in individual energy use under three behavioral scenarios. Our findings demonstrate that the regional dimension is important in a low-carbon economy transition. Heterogeneity in individual socio-demographics (e.g. education and age), structural characteristics (e.g. type and size of dwellings), behavioral and social traits (e.g. awareness and personal norms), and social interactions amplify these differences, causing nonlinearities in diffusion of green investments among households and macro-economic dynamics. © 2020 The Author(s)","Behavior change; Computational economics; Environmental modeling; Grassroots dynamics; Soft linking; Upscaling","Autonomous agents; Behavioral research; Climate models; Computational methods; Economic and social effects; International trade; Investments; Agent-based simulation models; Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium model; Greenhouse emissions; International markets; Social science theory; Structural characteristics; Three-step approach; Climate change; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; macroeconomics; market system; mitigation","Niamir, L.; Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC), Torgauer Str. 12-15, Germany; email: niamir@mcc-berlin.net",,"Elsevier Ltd",13648152,,EMSOF,,"English","Environ.

However, this same transparency also leads to heat loss which can offset heat gains. Although the use of insulated glazing addresses this challenge by multiplying the number of glass panes, at the same time it reduces the solar factor and thus the heating potential. This article aims to estimate the potential for passive solar heating in Europe according to the energy performance of glazing. This potential is undoubtedly a valuable resource for sustainable architecture. However, an analysis based on regional weather conditions shows a wide disparity in the energy savings that can be expected from a south-facing facade. These savings are most often well below a building's average energy consumption and so a balance has to be found between the thermal resistance and the solar factor of glazing. In addition, the carbon footprint and cost of the most efficient glazing can considerably extend the environmental and economic payback time of a retrofit. This research shows that the potential for passive solar heating is significant but only as long as each architectural situation is analysed according to its specific context and function. This potential would be even greater if windows were designed and used as adjustable facade elements to suit variations in weather and use. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",,"Carbon footprint; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Facades; Glazes; Solar energy; Solar heating; Stained glass; Transparency; Average energy; Building stocks; Climate change mitigation; Energy performance; Facade elements; Passive solar; Regional weather; Sustainable architecture; Climate change","Ménard, R.; UMR AUSser 3329, 12 Avenue Blaise Pascal, France; email: menard.raphael@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091204408

Early REDD+ programs and local/subnational projects used various interventions (i.e. enabling measures, disincentives and incentives), implemented by government, the commercial and non-commercial private sector, but are currently understudied vis-à-vis their effectiveness to address site-specific drivers of deforestation and forest degradation (DD). We assess how well REDD+ interventions addressed DD at five project sites in Peru (1), Brazil (1), Vietnam (1) and Indonesia (2). Our study design includes an integrated assessment of remotely sensed, spatially modelled, and locally reported drivers. First, we observe follow-up land use from high resolution imagery as proxy for direct deforestation drivers. Second, spatial Random Forest modelling of DD drivers allows for influence quantification of topographic, climatic and proximity variables at each site. Third, we report direct and indirect DD drivers from pre-intervention surveys and semi-structured interviews with five REDD+ implementers, 40 villages and 1200 households. Data gathered included perceived changes in forest cover and quality, and their causes. We found general agreement between observed, modelled and reported local DD drivers, yet some were inadequately addressed by interventions. Intra-site differences in drivers underscores the importance of analysing micro-level DD drivers. Our interdisciplinary approach reveals the complexities of local direct and indirect DD drivers, and the complementarity of remotely sensed, spatially modelled and locally reported methods for driver identification. A better understanding of the alignment between DD drivers and REDD+ interventions is vital for practitioners and policy makers to enhance the effectiveness, efficiency, equity and co-benefits of REDD+ at the local level. © 2020 The Authors","Data complementarity; Forest degradation; Interventions; Land use; Random Forest model; REDD+; Remote sensing","article; Brazil; climate change; deforestation; follow up; household; human; human experiment; imagery; Indonesia; land use; Peru; physician; random forest; remote sensing; semi structured interview; Viet Nam","Bos, A.B.; Wageningen University & Research, Droevendaalsesteeg 3, Netherlands; email: astrid.bos@wur.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

Using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) methodology, the farmers’ preferred mitigation and adaptation actions were identified and related to their stated attitudes regarding risks using the Multiple Price List (MPL) lotteries approach. Farmers’ environmental beliefs and perceptions as key means of understanding concepts of sustainability were related to their preferences. The use of less polluting machinery and investment in improving irrigation infrastructure were identified as the most preferred actions. Environmental opinions reviewed using the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale allowed for the identification of the participants’ ecocentric and anthropocentric attitudes, highlighting the commitment of most farmers to the sustainable use of natural resources.

The scenarios consider different technology assumptions on the availability of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and end-use efficiencies featuring electrification under a wide range of carbon price trajectories, which start at 1–690 USD/tCO2 in 2030, increase at 4.5%/year, and level off in 2100. This scenario design allows close examination of energy, economic, and environmental implications of different levels of policy stringency and carbon budgets. While improving end-use efficiencies consistently decrease policy costs for a wide range of carbon budgets, the value of BECCS availability in terms of cost reduction is crucial only in a limited range toward lower budgets. Constraints on BECCS, including those indirectly imposed by the limited bioenergy supply, also tend to narrow the lower range of attainable budget levels, indicating technological and economic challenges, although they may have an impact on reducing the total budget including land-use emissions.

These scenarios, however, also show a very wide range of results, with uncertainty about bioenergy conversion technology deployment and biomass feedstock supply. To date, the underlying differences in model assumptions and parameters for the range of results have not been conveyed. Here we explore the models and results of the 33rd study of the Stanford Energy Modeling Forum to elucidate and explore bioenergy technology specifications and constraints that underlie projected bioenergy outcomes. We first develop and report consistent bioenergy technology characterizations and modeling details. We evaluate the bioenergy technology specifications through a series of analyses—comparison with the literature, model intercomparison, and an assessment of bioenergy technology projected deployments. We find that bioenergy technology coverage and characterization varies substantially across models, spanning different conversion routes, carbon capture and storage opportunities, and technology deployment constraints. Still, the range of technology specification assumptions is largely in line with bottom-up engineering estimates. We then find that variation in bioenergy deployment across models cannot be understood from technology costs alone. Important additional determinants include biomass feedstock costs, the availability and costs of alternative mitigation options in and across end-uses, the availability of carbon dioxide removal possibilities, the speed with which large scale changes in the makeup of energy conversion facilities and integration can take place, and the relative demand for different energy services. © 2020, The Author(s).","Bioenergy; Biomass; Climate policy; Integrated assessment models; Scenario analysis; Technological change","Biomass; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Energy conversion; Feedstocks; Specifications; Bio-energy conversion technology; Bioenergy technology; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change mitigation; Conversion facility; Integrated assessment models; Model inter comparisons; Technology deployment; Climate change; assessment method; bioenergy; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; integrated approach; mitigation; parameterization; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis","Daioglou, V.; Copernicus Institute of Sustainable development, Princetonlaan 8a, Netherlands; email: vassilis.daioglou@pbl.nl",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Peatland rewetting substantially lowers these emissions. After rewetting, paludiculture (i.e. agriculture and forestry on wet peatlands) is a promising land use option. In Northeast Germany (291,361 ha of peatland) a multi-stakeholder discussion process about the implementation of paludiculture took place in 2016/2017. Currently, 57% of the peatland area is used for agriculture (7% as arable land, 50% as permanent grassland), causing greenhouse gas emissions of 4.5 Mt CO2eq a−1. By rewetting and implementing paludiculture, up to 3 Mt CO2eq a−1 from peat soils could be avoided. To safeguard interests of both nature conservation and agriculture, the different types of paludiculture were grouped into ‘cropping paludiculture’ and ‘permanent grassland paludiculture’. Based on land legislation and plans, a paludiculture land classification was developed. On 52% (85,468 ha) of the agriculturally used peatlands any type of paludiculture may be implemented. On 30% (49,929 ha), both cropping and permanent grassland paludiculture types are possible depending on administrative check. On 17% (28,827 ha), nature conservation restrictions allow only permanent grassland paludiculture. We recommend using this planning approach in all regions with high greenhouse gas emissions from drained peatlands to avoid land use conflicts. © 2020, The Author(s).","Cropping paludiculture; Eligibility map; Governance; Greenhouse gas emissions; Organic soils; Permanent grassland paludiculture","cropping practice; drainage network; environmental legislation; grassland; greenhouse gas; land classification; nature conservation; peat soil; peatland; rewetting; Germany","Tanneberger, F.; DUENE e.V., Soldmannstraße 15, Germany; email: tanne@uni-greifswald.de",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",02775212,,,,"English","Wetlands",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087854581

This study aims to provide evidences about perception, motivation and attitude for climate change mitigation through energy conservation. The survey is conducted in Dhaka and Islamabad on deploying in-total 800 self-administered questionnaires, whereas the analysis is done through descriptive statistics and the logistic model. The study finds that perception about benefits, cue to action, self-efficacy is deficient among residents of both the countries. Further, the attitude toward reduction of the use of gasoline, energy consumption at home, recycling of waste and water conservation is also not optimistic among the majority of the residents in both the capital cities. The results of the logistic model also reveal that individuals; who believe that climate change can endanger their life, have higher income and education and they are more likely to take mitigation strategies in both Bangladesh and Pakistan. Thus, the study suggests that the governments in both the countries should take necessary measures to sensitise people about taking necessary mitigation measures also energy conservation, through awareness campaigns. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy conservation; Mitigation; Personal perception; South Asia; Theory of Planned Behavior",,"Alvi, S.; School of Social Sciences and Humanities (S3H), Pakistan; email: shahzad.alvi@s3h.nust.edu.pk",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

In the Sonoran Desert of Mexico, Hermosillo is the largest city with a population of 710,000. This city is currently affected by dust pollution and a large part of its population suffers respiratory diseases. Moreover, Hermosillo is considered highly vulnerable to climate change. The objective of this work was to correlate socio-economic variables such as population density and unpaved cover to total suspended particles (TSP), daily temperature oscillation (DTO), and vegetation cover (VC) to establish priority zones for reforestation for the city government. We divided Hermosillo in 440 sampling areas corresponding to Basic Geostatistics Urban Areas (AGEB) as defined by Instituto Nacional de Estadística Geografía e Informática (INEGI). We estimated TSP and DTO for each AGEB by spatial interpolation using the splines with barriers from 3 and 7 sampling stations, respectively. We obtained population density for each AGEB from the 2010 Population and Housing Census by INEGI and percentage of unpaved cover for each AGEB from municipal government records. We mapped VC analyzing digital aerial ortho-photos (resolution 15 × 15 cm per pixel) using GIS and manual digitization. We estimated VC at the AGEB level by sampling. Average VC percentage for Hermosillo is 6.4%. We also found that VC is negatively associated with TSP and DTO, highlighting the importance of further increasing green cover to enhance urban life quality in arid lands. Population density (PD) and unpaved cover (UC) were also positively correlated to DTO and marginally with TSP. Our research approach at a local scale, using an accessible methodology and inexpensive data inputs, can be easily applied to other arid cities around the world. We produced a map of prioritization reforestation zones for Hermosillo. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Daily temperature oscillation; Desert city; Total suspended particles; Urban planning; Vegetation cover",,"Ortega-Rosas, C.I.; Maestría en Sistemas de Producción Biosustentable, Ley Federal del Trabajo SN.

In the agriculture sector, these impacts of climate change are visibly affecting plant growth and productivity, and tea is no exception to these impacts. In north-eastern India, changes in the weather pattern has been witnessed in terms of decrease of around 200 mm rainfall over the years, increase in average temperature of around 1.3 °C over the last 93 years, increase in number of days with more than 35 °C, specially in last thirty years. The decline in annual rainfall is matched with a prominent shift in distribution of monthly rainfall pattern. The monthly rainfall is more in the late monsoon and winter months. Another important aspect is the rising carbon dioxide concentration in atmosphere. In recent years it has increased to 398 ppm in the state of Assam which is many fold higher than the level of carbon dioxide in the last decade which was quantified to be around 364 ppm in the year 2008. As a consequence of these climatic changes, there has been already a paradigm shift in overall pest scenario associated with tea in the recent years. At present, tea pests cause more damage to the crop through increased reproductive potential, feeding rate, distribution pattern, shorter duration of development stages and consequently with more number of annual generations, migration etc. along with some of the secondary pest outbreaks. A number of areas for future research on the effect of climatic changes on insect pests of tea need to be identified on priority basis. An in-depth investigation on the influence of the changed climatic factors on the variability, load, population dynamics, behavior and migration of the tea pests vis à vis the crop can be helpful in proper pest monitoring and management. Some real time strategies adopted to combat and manage tea production by mitigating the effect of the climate change are discussed in this paper. © 2019 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Ecological Society of China.","Climate change Tea Northeast India New insect pest Emergence seasonal occurrence Behavioural change mitigation strategy","agrometeorology; carbon dioxide; climate change; monsoon; paradigm shift; pest outbreak; precipitation intensity; tea; vulnerability; Assam; India; Hexapoda","Roy, S.; Entomology Department, India; email: somnathento@gmail.com",,"Science Press",10000933,,,,"English","Shengtai Xuebao Acta Ecol.

The United Kingdom (UK) has the second highest malting capacity in the EU and the third largest malting industry in the world, supplying malt to major global breweries. Premium whisky, which has both economic and cultural significance for the UK, also makes sustainable malt barley supply critical for the UK. There is paucity of information on the sustainability of future supplies of malt barley in the UK, as much as it is in the world. This study applied a food balance approach to assess the combined effects of climate change and mitigation policies on UK malt barley balances for the 2030s, 2040 s, and 2050 s. Future yields of spring barley were simulated under the low, medium and high emissions scenarios (or LES, MES, and HES, respectively) for the three time slices. Future areas of land for barley production were obtained via land use change simulation in response to climate mitigation policies and aspirations of the UK. Future yields and land areas were combined to obtain total barley production, which served as a basis of supply. Per capita malt barley consumption was combined with future population to obtain demand. The gaps between demand and supply were then assessed. The results show large deficits in malt barley supplies for all combinations of climate change, land use and population, with adverse implications for the malting industry. Total malt barley supplies under current land area for barley and using the 90th percentile yield, ranged from 1899 (LES, 2030s) to 2,437 thousand tonnes (HES, 2050s). The largest supply under climate mitigation land use scenarios ranged from 1,592 (LES, 2030s) to 2,120 thousand tonnes (HES, 2050s). Deficits in supply were observed for all climate mitigation land use scenarios and time slices, ranging from 128 to 585 thousand tonnes at 90th percentile yield. However, surpluses were observed from the 2040s if current land area for barley remains unchanged. Imports to balance the observed deficits would result in large inflows of blue water to the UK, with adverse implications for global freshwater supply and environmental sustainability. It is concluded that even though spring barley yields in the UK could increase under projected climate change, reductions in croplands (due mainly to climate mitigation policies and aspirations) could combine with population growth to undermine the sustainability of malt barley supplies, both nationally and internationally. © 2020, The Author(s).",,,"Yawson, D.O.; Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES), P.O.

Participants responded to a series of scales focused on assessing CCMB such as household thermic comfort, pro-environmental family orientation, and perceptions of the city’s pro-environmental public facilities, services, and community values. All of these situational factors were significantly interrelated, which suggests that they all affect CCMB. Yet, according to a structural model, the only factor that resulted in a significant (and more salient) direct influence on CCMB was pro-environmental family orientation. A second structural model indicated that household thermic comfort, pro-environmental public facilities/services, and pro-environmental public values had an indirect effect on CCMB mediated by pro-environmental family orientation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Family; Mitigation behavior; Situational factors; Structural models","anthropogenic source; climate change; greenhouse gas; numerical model; participatory approach; perception; Mexico [North America]","Corral-Verdugo, V.; Department of Psychology, Mexico; email: victorcorral@sociales.uson.mx",,"Springer Science and Business Media B.V.",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

The particular perspective we inhabit is determinant of what we can know. Perspective or ‘approach’ is therefore foregrounded by complexity thinkers as an active part of knowing and acting. We take a complexity view of climate change mitigation policymaking to argue that climate change mitigation policy communities have a dominant approach, which determines both our understanding of the climate change mitigation policy problem, and how we respond to it. To construct this argument, we first summarize and describe the existence of a hegemonic scientific and cultural worldview. We use multi-disciplinary literatures to demonstrate how this worldview operates in the approach of the international climate change mitigation policy community. Finally, we draw on empirical datasets to describe how the influence of this worldview characterizes the dominant approach of the South African climate change mitigation policy community. That climate change mitigation policy communities have a dominant approach means that, whilst aspects of the complex policy situation are illuminated by this approach, others are obscured. It is clear from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report on 1.5°C warming that policymakers are not yet responding adequately to the problem. If approach determines what we see and how we act, it follows that approach can be interrogated as an active site of the policy challenge. A complexity view, for instance, enables us to see differently, emphasizing perspective, impartial knowledge, non-linearities and emergence in complexity and complex systems. This in turn has implications for our policymaking. Key policy insights Policymakers should explore how an understanding of approach informs climate change mitigation policymaking. Climate change mitigation policy communities should critically examine the underlying assumptions and worldviews that influence both how we encounter climate change mitigation and how we act upon it. An appreciation of ‘approach’ demands skills not typically valued or taught to climate change mitigation policymakers, with implications for climate change mitigation policy curricula and the composition of policymaking teams Complexity thinking opens up spaces for policymaking currently obscured by the dominant climate change mitigation policy approaches. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate mitigation; complex systems; complexity thinking; Policy approach; reflexivity; South Africa","climate change; complexity; environmental policy; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; mitigation; policy analysis; policy approach; policy making; South Africa","Tyler, E.; Energy Research Centre and African Climate and Development Institute, South Africa; email: Emily.tyler@uct.ac.za",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

In order to support the recycling of materials, it is necessary to determine the quantities in the building stock and those caused by construction activities. At present, a large number of different actors use different categories for construction materials and the raw materials they consist of as well as for waste categories, depending on their field of activity. This results in imprecisions that make it difficult to consistently track and influence mass flows and hinder targeted resource management. This is the starting point of this paper as it discusses possibilities to establish a consistent allocation of materials to context-typical groups following the approach of continuous material flow analysis. On the input-side, aspects of mineral planning and on the output-side aspects of waste and secondary raw material management are being considered and references to grey emissions are established along the entire process chain. In this way, cross-departmental planning relating to recycling management and climate protection will be supported. With regard to the object of consideration and the level of action, a distinction is made between two different spatial scale levels: on the one hand, the individual building level, where the material inventory approach is used to provide detailed information on the building's material composition, and on the other hand the regional level, for which more aggregated information on building material groups is provided in the form of material cadastres.

This study compares the environmental and economic performance of two such technologies, fast pyrolysis and gasification, with conventional disposal methods for treating polypropylene (PP) waste. High-fidelity process simulations for each technology are conducted to obtain the necessary mass, energy, and economic data for subsequent analyses. Through an extensive life cycle assessment utilizing the IPCC 2013, ReCiPe, and ILCD 2.0 methods, fast pyrolysis and gasification are determined to have lower overall greenhouse gas emissions and better overall environmental performance than the conventional methods of incineration and landfilling. The chemical recycling systems are also found to be considerably profitable with fast pyrolysis and gasification having total NPVs of $149MM and $96MM, respectively. The discount rate, waste PP price, and plant life are the most influential factors for the economic performance of both systems. © 2020 American Chemical Society.","Chemical recycling; Circular economy; Life cycle assessment; Technoeconomic analysis; Waste polypropylene","Climate change; Economic analysis; Emission control; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Gasification; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Polypropylenes; Pyrolysis; Rhenium compounds; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Chemical recycling system; Climate change mitigation; Conventional methods; Economic performance; Environmental and economic performance; Environmental performance; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Process simulations; Plastic recycling","You, F.; Robert Frederick Smith School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, United States; email: fengqi.you@cornell.edu",,"American Chemical Society",21680485,,,,"English","ACS Sustainable Chem.

In this study, we have proposed CO2 capture and storage via hydrate in geological formation within the hydrate stability zone as a novel technique to contribute to global warming mitigation strategies, including carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) and to prevent vast methane release into the atmosphere caused by hydrate melting. We have attempted to enhance total gas uptake and CO2 capture efficiency in hydrate in the presence of kinetic promoters while using diluted CO2 gas (CO2-N2 mixture). Experiments are performed using unfrozen sands within hydrate stability zone condition and in the presence of low dosage surfactant and amino acids. Hydrate formation parameters, including sub-cooling temperature, induction time, total gas uptake, and split fraction, are calculated during the single-step formation and dissociation process. The effect of sands with varying particle sizes (160–630 µm, 1400–5000 µm), low dosage promoter (500–3000 ppm) and CO2 concentration in feed gas (20–30 mol%) on formation kinetic parameters was investigated. Enhanced formation kinetics are observed in the presence of surfactant (1000–3000 ppm) and hydrophobic amino acids (3000 ppm) at 120 bar and 1 °C experimental conditions. We report induction time in the range of 7–170 min and CO2 split fraction (0.60–0.90) in hydrate for 120 bar initial injection pressure. CO2 split fraction can be enhanced by reducing sand particle size or increasing the CO2 mol% in incoming feed gas at given injection pressure. This study also reports that formation kinetics in a porous medium are influenced by hydrate morphology. Hydrate morphology influences gas and water migration within sediments and controls pore space or particle surface correlation with the formation kinetics within coarse sediments. This investigation demonstrates the potential application of bio-friendly amino acids as promoters to enhance CO2 capture and storage within hydrate. Sufficient contact time at gas-liquid interface and higher CO2 separation efficiency is recorded in the presence of amino acids. The findings of this study could be useful in exploring the promoter-driven pore habitat of CO2-rich hydrates in sediments to address climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Amino acids; Climate change; CO2 capture and sequestration; Formation kinetics; Marine sands; Permafrost","Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Dissociation; Efficiency; Gases; Geology; Global warming; Hydration; Kinetics; Morphology; Particle size; Phase interfaces; Porous materials; Sediments; Surface active agents; Carbon capture , utilization , and storages; Dissociation process; Experimental conditions; Gas-liquid interface; Geological formation; Geological sequestration; Hydrate stabilities; Hydrophobic amino acids; Gas hydrates","Solms, N.V.; Center for Energy Resource Engineering (CERE), 2800 Kgs, Denmark; email: nvs@kt.dtu.dk",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100974268

We use the Open Source Energy Modeling System (OSeMOSYS) to analyze scenarios that consider greater uptake of LDEVs in different time frames, implementation of a CO2 emission restriction policy, exclusion of fossil fuels from the power mix, and a combination of these policies. We find that carbon pricing, along with higher rates of LDEVs adoption, causes the highest emission reductions (up to 47%), albeit at higher costs. LDEVs become the preferred vehicle technology as soon as they reach cost parity with internal combustion engine vehicles in different scenarios. Greater LDEVs uptake, however, leads to increased electricity consumption (up to 3%), which is provided by fossil fuels when there is no emission restriction policy. If restrictions are placed on the expansion of fossil fuel power plants, fewer LDEVs are adopted (up to less than 26%) because there is not enough electricity to supply the demand. Given the state’s power mix in 2016 (58% provided by fossil fuels), investment in zero-carbon energy is necessary for mitigation policies in the transportation sector to be effective. © 2020 by the authors.

Documenting the benefits can help drive more ambitious and health-protective climate change mitigation actions; however, documenting the adverse health effects can help to avoid them. Estimating the health effects of mitigation (HEM) actions can help policy makers prioritize investments based not only on mitigation potential but also on expected health benefits. To date, however, the wide range of incompatible approaches taken to developing and reporting HEM estimates has limited their comparability and usefulness to policymakers. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this effort was to generate guidance for modeling studies on scoping, estimating, and reporting population health effects from climate change mitigation actions. METHODS: An expert panel of HEM researchers was recruited to participate in developing guidance for conducting HEM studies. The primary literature and a synthesis of HEM studies were provided to the panel. Panel members then participated in a modified Delphi exercise to identify areas of consensus regarding HEM estimation. Finally, the panel met to review and discuss consensus findings, resolve remaining differences, and generate guidance regarding conducting HEM studies. RESULTS: The panel generated a checklist of recommendations regarding stakeholder engagement: HEM modeling, including model structure, scope and scale, demographics, time horizons, counterfactuals, health response functions, and metrics; parameterization and reporting; approaches to uncertainty and sensitivity analysis; accounting for policy uptake; and discounting. DISCUSSION: This checklist provides guidance for conducting and reporting HEM estimates to make them more comparable and useful for policymakers. Harmonization of HEM estimates has the potential to lead to advances in and improved synthesis of policy-relevant research that can inform evidence-based decision making and practice. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP6745. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This data is practically the same recorded in the previous year, suggesting that the country’s trajectory of CO2 emissions is stabilized. Methods: This study presents an overview of environmental protection and climate change mitigation policies adopted in Brazil, as well as makes use the multilevel regression modeling technique to investigate the relationship between economic activities variables in relation to CO2 emissions over the years of 1970 to 2018 in all Brazilian states. Results: The results show that the CO2 emissions in the states have the same behavior as the timeline of the change in land use. Conclusions: The public policies and actions by society and the private sector were fundamental to the reduction verified from the year of 2004 that followed until 2010, both in CO2 emissions and in the change in land use and forests. As of this year, there has been a trend towards stability in CO2 emissions. Another important characteristic is that even with a drop in the number of deforestation, the production variables continued to grow, which shows that there may be an increase in production activities, while there is a reduction in deforestation and in CO2 emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

A comprehensive, interdisciplinary methodology was developed that bridged climate change and building modeling. The residential building stock of Qatar was considered, with a two-story residential villa selected as a representative of the stock and consequently a case study. Weather scenarios were created for the years 2020, 2050, and 2080, and four building renovation scenarios were developed. The findings suggested that without any mitigation measures, residential building energy consumption in Qatar could increase by up to 9%, 17%, and 30% in 2020, 2050, and 2080, respectively. The addition of 5-cm expanded polystyrene and the installation of energy-efficient windows proved to be far more efficient than the addition of green walls and roofs under the climate conditions (30% reduction in energy consumption vs. 3%). Additionally, the environmental impact of green wall and roof maintenance, specific to Qatar, should be considered.

Here we conduct a state-of-the-art estimate of the spatial-temporal variability of GHG emissions intensities for wheat, maize, and rice in China from 1949 to 2012 using an improved agricultural ecosystem model (Dynamic Land Ecosystem Model-Agriculture Version 2.0) and meta-analysis covering 172 field-GHG emissions experiments. The results show that the GHG emissions intensities of these croplands from 1949 to 2012, on average, were 0.10–1.31 kg CO2-eq/kg, with a significant increase rate of 1.84–3.58 × 10–3 kg CO2-eq kg−1 year−1. Nitrogen fertilizer was the dominant factor contributing to the increase in GHG emissions intensity in northern China and increased its impact in southern China in the 2000s. Increasing GHG emissions intensity implies that excessive fertilizer failed to markedly stimulate crop yield increase in China but still exacerbated soil GHG emissions. This study found that overfertilization of more than 60% was mainly located in the winter wheat–summer maize rotation systems in the North China Plain, the winter wheat–rice rotation systems in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and southwest China, and most of the double rice systems in the South. Our simulations suggest that roughly a one-third reduction in the current N fertilizer application level over these “overfertilization” regions would not significantly influence crop yield but decrease soil GHG emissions by 29.60%–32.50% and GHG emissions intensity by 0.13–0.25 kg CO2-eq/kg. This reduction is about 29% and 5% of total agricultural soil GHG emissions in China and the world, respectively. This study suggests that improving nitrogen use efficiency would be an effective strategy to mitigate GHG emissions and sustain China's food security. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","crop yield; food security; GHG emissions intensity; greenhouse gases mitigation; optimum fertilizer application; overfertilization","agricultural production; climate change; crop yield; fertilizer application; food security; greenhouse gas; soil organic matter; spatiotemporal analysis; China; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays","Tian, H.; International Center for Climate and Global Change Research, United States; email: tianhan@auburn.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13541013,,,"32697859","English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090058990

Here we perform a global spatially explicit analysis of life-cycle GHG emissions for lignocellulosic crop-based BECCS. We show that negative emissions greatly depend on biomass cultivation location, treatment of original vegetation, the final energy carrier produced and the evaluation period considered. We find a global potential of 28 EJ per year for electricity with negative emissions, sequestering 2.5 GtCO2 per year when accounting emissions over 30 years, which increases to 220 EJ per year and 40 GtCO2 per year over 80 years.

Most building LCA studies focus on core and shell (C&amp;S) and rarely assess mechanical, electrical, and plumbing (MEP) and tenant improvements (TI). However, C&amp;S typologies in the commercial sector pose particular challenges to achieving net zero carbon due to the numerous renovations these building undergo through during their service life. MEP and TI are installed multiple times over the lifetime of commercial buildings leading to cumulative environmental impact caused by increasing material quantities and embodied carbon (EC). This study aimed to establish a preliminary range of material quantities and embodied carbon impacts for MEP and TI components, focusing on commercial office buildings in the Pacific Northwest. The first research stage involved quantifying material quantities while a second stage aimed to calculate Embodied Carbon Coefficients (ECC) and LCA impacts using different data sources.

So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to $131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 °C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth’s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately. © 2020, The Author(s).","Carbon dioxide removal; Climate change mitigation; Decarbonization technologies; Negative emissions technologies; Radiative forcing geoengineering technologies",,"Osman, A.I.; School of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering, David Keir Building, Stranmillis Road, United Kingdom; email: aosmanahmed01@qub.ac.uk",,"Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH",16103653,,,,"English","Environ.

They are prone to various hazards such as drought, flood, forest fire, landslide and therefore physical, ecological and social systems of the mountains are at risk. Climate change adds to intensifying the magnitude of multi-hazard risk in mountains. The present study attempts to evaluate risk induced by multi-hazard and climate change in the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR) using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) framework. The proposed multi-hazard risk index was based on indicators from a broader domain and applied on 109 administrative districts of IHR. Exposure, sensitivity, adaptive capacity, and coping capacity were defined using comprehensive and sub-regional indicators identified through inductive and deductive approaches. The result showed that the differential risks among the districts of IHR were governed by the multiplicity of the factor such as demography, amenities, natural capital, partnership, technology and spatial specificities of the districts. The result highlighted the need of inclusion of spatial specificities for the risk mitigation in the IHR and therefore a Mountain Specific Risk Management Framework (MSMRMF) was proposed for sustaining the mountainous communities. The proposed MSMRMF contained two broad components as risk assessment and risk addressal. The framework detailed the risk mitigation and coping strategies (based on adjustment of internal and external strengths) for addressing risks. Risk mitigation was proposed to achieved through habitation resilience, natural capital enhancement, external partnerships, climate change adaptation, and technological interventions. The framework would provide an insight of risk and risk management strategies for the multi-hazard prone mountain regions for the sustainable development under the global change. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate service; Coping capacity; Resilience; Societal response; Vulnerability","Deforestation; Demography; Hazards; Landforms; Planning; Risk assessment; Risk management; Adaptive capacity; Climate change adaptation; Climate change risks; Coping strategies; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Mountain regions; Risk management framework; Risk management strategies; Climate change; adaptive management; administrative framework; coping strategy; drought; flood; forest fire; hazard management; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; landslide; mitigation; mountain region; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; Himalayas; India","Pandey, R.; Indian Council of Forestry Research & EducationIndia; email: rajivfri@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

This paper evaluates and ranks global cities based on economic performance and climate change mitigation using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Regular and super-efficiency DEA models are developed under natural disposability and managerial disposability, implying different priorities given to economy and climate change. We apply the models to a dataset of 39 global cities obtained from the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, the biggest coalition of global cities to coordinate the cities’ mitigation efforts. The greenhouse gas emissions are classified into scopes 1–3, all of which are treated as undesirable outputs in DEA. In regular DEA models, we identify nine cities that achieve perfect efficiencies regardless of the disposability framework. In super-efficiency models, three cities (Sydney, Tokyo, Vancouver) are always placed into the top five positions. Buenos Aires and Cape Town always fall into the bottom five. The rankings with only scope 1 emissions are significantly correlated with those of all emissions, though with a few notable exceptions (Vancouver and Bogota). The performance of African cities is impeded by scope 2 and scope 3 emissions. The ranking results can be linked to the cities’ economic structure and energy mix. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Global cities; Managerial disposability; Ranking; Super-efficiency DEA","Climate models; Data envelopment analysis; Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Buenos Aires; Climate change mitigation; Economic performance; Economic structure; Energy mix; Global cities; Super efficiency; Super efficiency dea models; Climate change","Wang, D.; School of Business Administration, 121 Zhangjialukou, China; email: derek.wang@mcgill.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088117885

Thus, we would like to make the following corrections: When stated: “One of the most promising initiatives in this context was the program “Allied Insects”, which used insects containing certain viruses as vectors to help crops fight threats such as drought or pollution (Ford et al., 2010). CRISPR-based gene drives have been proposed as a way to reduce or eliminate insect-borne diseases, control invasive species and even reverse insecticide resistance in pests, but researchers worry about the consequences of unleashing this new technology (Champer et al., 2017). Reeves et al. (2018), however, have recently questioned the program, in such a prestigious journal as Science. These authors suspect that the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) may somehow have funded the project to breach existing international treaties against the proliferation of biological weapons established in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).” It should say: “One of the most promising initiatives in this context was the program “Allied Insects”, which used insects containing certain viruses as vectors to help crops fight threats such as drought or pollution. CRISPR-based gene drives have been proposed as a way to reduce or eliminate insect-borne diseases, control invasive species and even reverse insecticide resistance in pests, but researchers worry about the consequences of unleashing this new technology (Champer et al., 2017). Reeves et al. (2018), however, have recently questioned the program, in such a prestigious journal as Science. These authors open an interesting debate on the possibility that these investigations could become distorted and, in this way, they could serve to be used for warlike purposes, finding a way to circumvent the existing international treaties against the proliferation of biological weapons established in the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC).” In fact, Reeves et al. (2018) in the article titled “Agricultural research, or a new bioweapon system?” indicates textually “(…) In the context of the stated aims of the DARPA program, it is our opinion that the knowledge to be gained from this program appears very limited in its capacity to enhance US agriculture or respond to national emergencies (in either the short or long term). Furthermore, there has been an absence of adequate discussion regarding the best practical and regulatory impediments toward realizing the projected agricultural benefits. As a result, the program may be widely perceived as an effort to develop biological agents for hostile purposes and their means of delivery, which —if true— would constitute a breach of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)”. Reeves et al. (2018) ends they article with the phrases ”Reversal of funding for this DARPA project by the US Congress (…) would not in itself close the particular Pandora's box that HEGAAs or their insect dispersal may represent. Nonetheless, there is a compelling argument that nowhere has bold leadership for the benefit of humankind been more internationally reciprocated than in the control of the use, development, or stockpiling of biological weapons.“ The authors would like to apologize for any inconvenience caused to the readers to whom we recommend a careful reading of the above-mentioned article (Reeves et al., 2018) since it is evident that at no time the authors suspect that DARPA wants to breech the BWC, although it is evident that they warn about the dangers associated with this type of research. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"erratum","Simal-Gandara, J.; Nutrition and Bromatology Group, Spain; email: jsimal@uvigo.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",09639969,,FORIE,"33233176","English","Food Res.

In this specific case study, a set of values – equality and autonomy – central to the Ngaju people, the indigenous population in Central Kalimantan, become contested in the course of the climate change mitigation project. These central values are produced in everyday activities that include mobility and the productive base – subsistence and market-based production – among the Ngaju people. On the other hand, the climate change mitigation project-related environmental practices and actions produce values that point to individual (material) benefit and stratification of the society.

Inland and coastal wetlands (specifically boreal, temperate and tropical peatlands; tundra; floodplains; freshwater marshes; saltmarshes; and mangroves) are among the most efficient natural long-term carbon sinks. Yet, they also release methane (CH 4) that can offset the carbon they sequester. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis on wetland carbon dynamics to (i) determine their impact on climate using different metrics and time horizons, (ii) investigate the cost-effectiveness of wetland restoration for climate change mitigation, and (iii) discuss their suitability for inclusion in climate policy as negative emission technologies. Depending on metrics, a wetland can simultaneously be a net carbon sink (i.e. boreal and temperate peatlands net ecosystem carbon budget =-28.1 ± 19.13 gC m-2 y-1) but have a net warming effect on climate at the 100 years time-scale (i.e. boreal and temperate peatland sustained global warming potential = 298.2 ± 100.6 gCO 2 eq-1 m-2 y-1). This situation creates ambivalence regarding the effect of wetlands on global temperature. Moreover, our review reveals high heterogeneity among the (limited number of) studies that document wetland carbon budgets. We demonstrate that most coastal and inland wetlands have a net cooling effect as of today. This is explained by the limited CH 4 emissions that undisturbed coastal wetlands produce, and the long-term carbon sequestration performed by older inland wetlands as opposed to the short lifetime of CH 4 in the atmosphere. Analysis of wetland restoration costs relative to the amount of carbon they can sequester revealed that restoration is more cost-effective in coastal wetlands such as mangroves (US$1800 ton C-1) compared with inland wetlands (US$4200-49 200 ton C-1). We advise that for inland wetlands, priority should be given to conservation rather than restoration; while for coastal wetlands, both conservation and restoration may be effective techniques for climate change mitigation. © 2020 The Author(s).","blue carbon; carbon dioxide removal; ecological restoration; nature-based solutions; Paris agreement; peatland",,"Taillardat, P.; Université du Québec À Montreál-GeotopCanada; email: taillardat.pierre@courrier.uqam.ca",,"Royal Society Publishing",20428898,,,,"English","Interface Focus",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094967409

Understanding why ranchers adopt managed grazing is key to developing the right incentives. In this paper, we explore principles and practices associated with the larger enterprise of 'regenerative ranching' (RR), which includes managed grazing but infuses the practice with holistic decision-making. We argue that this broader approach is appealing due to a suite of ecological, economic and social benefits, making climate change mitigation an afterthought, or 'co-benefit'. RR is challenging, however, because it requires a deep understanding of ecological processes along with a set of skills related to monitoring and moving livestock and feeding the soil microbiome. We review the literature regarding links between RR and SCS, then present results of qualitative research focused on motivators, enablers and constraints associated with RR, drawing on interviews with 52 practitioners in New South Wales, Australia and the western United States. Our analysis is guided by a conceptual model of the social-ecological system associated with RR that identifies determinants of regenerative potential. We discuss implications for rancher engagement and conclude with a consideration of leverage points for global scalability. © 2020 The Authors.","holistic planned grazing; natural climate solutions; regenerative agriculture; resilience; social-ecological systems; soil carbon sequestration",,"Gosnell, H.; College of Earth Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences, United States; email: gosnellh@geo.oregonstate.edu",,"Royal Society Publishing",20428898,,,,"English","Interface Focus",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094943229

Reducing the use of air conditioners is one such measure. While it seems to be effective in mitigating climate change, it may also reduce individuals’ well-being and increase the risk of heatstroke. To compare the impact of reducing air conditioner use and the mortality risks, the indicator Loss of Happy Life Expectancy (LHpLE), which measures the reduction in the length of life that individuals can spend happily, was used. The reduction in well-being due to non-use of air conditioners was obtained by applying the propensity score matching method to the results of a questionnaire. We evaluated the impact of reducing air conditioner use in both the current and future situation in comparison to the mortality risk from flood and heatstroke, respectively. The increase in mortality risk due to flooding was estimated based on numerical simulation, and the increase in the risk of mortality due to heatstroke was estimated based on existing reports in Japan. Using these results, the magnitude of the impacts on LHpLE caused by the reduction in well-being due to the non-use of an air conditioner and the increase in the mortality risks were compared, both for the current situation and the future. The results show that LHpLE due to non-use of air conditioners was much greater than that due to the risk of mortality due to flood and heatstroke, and implied that reducing air conditioner use is not necessarily a good way as a mitigation measure. This result would be useful for creating and implementing measures to counter climate change and could also be applied in many other fields. © 2020 by the authors.

However, there areknowledge gaps in our understanding of the quantity and distribution in tropical regions. Specifically, Mexican wetlands have not been considered in global carbon budgets or carbon balances for a number of reasons, such as: (1) the lack of data, (2) Spanish publications have not been selected, or (3) because such balances are mainly made in the English language. This study analyzes the literature regarding carbon stocks, sequestration and fluxes in Mexican forested wetlands (Forest-W). Soil carbon stocks of 8, 24.5 and 40.1 kg cm−2 were detected for flooded palms, mangroves, and freshwater or swamps (FW) wetland soils, respectively, indicating that FW soils are the Forest-W with more potential for carbon sinks (p = 0.023), compared to mangroves and flooded palm soils. While these assessments of carbon sequestration were ranged from 36 to 920 g-C m−2 year−1, C emitted as methane was also tabulated (0.6–196 g-C m−2 year−1). Subtracting the C emitted of the C sequestered, 318.2 g-C m−2 year−1 were obtained. Such data revealed that Forest-W function is mainly as carbon sink, and not C source. This review can help to inform practitioners in future decisions regarding sustainable projects, restoration, conservation or creation of wetlands. Finally, it is concluded that Forest-W could be key ecosystems in strategies addressing the mitigation of climate change through carbon storage. However, new studies in this research line and public policies that protect these essential carbon sinks are necessary in order to, hopefully, elaborate global models to make more accurate predictions about future climate. © 2020 by the authors.

Yet livestock farmers across Europe receive billions of dollars in annual subsidies to support their livelihoods. This study evaluates whether diverting European subsidies into the restoration of trees on abandoned farmland represents a cost-effective negative-emissions strategy for mitigating climate change. Focusing on sheep farming in the United Kingdom, and on natural regeneration and planted native forests, we show that, without subsidies, sheep farming is not profitable when farmers are paid for their labour. Despite the much lower productivity of upland farms, upland and lowland farms are financially comparable per hectare. Conversion to 'carbon forests' is possible via natural regeneration when close to existing trees, which are seed sources. This strategy is financially viable without subsidies, meeting the net present value of poorly performing sheep farming at a competitive $4/tCO2eq. If tree planting is required to establish forests, then ∼$55/tCO2eq is needed to break-even, making it uneconomical under current carbon market prices without financial aid to cover establishment costs. However, this break-even price is lower than the theoretical social value of carbon ($68/tCO2eq), which represents the economic cost of CO2 emissions to society. The viability of land-use conversion without subsidies therefore depends on low farm performance, strong likelihood of natural regeneration, and high carbon-market price, plus overcoming potential trade-offs between the cultural and social values placed on pastoral livestock systems and climate change mitigation. The morality of subsidising farming practices that cause high GHG emissions in Europe, whilst spending billions annually on protecting forest carbon in less developed nations to slow climate change is questionable. © 2020 The Author(s).

If intact peatlands are drained for agriculture or other human uses, peat oxidation can result in considerable CO2 emissions and other greenhouse gases (GHG) for decades or even centuries. Despite their importance, emissions from degraded peatlands have so far not been included explicitly in mitigation pathways compatible with the Paris Agreement. Such pathways include land-demanding mitigation options like bioenergy or afforestation with substantial consequences for the land system. Therefore, besides GHG emissions owing to the historic conversion of intact peatlands, the increased demand for land in current mitigation pathways could result in drainage of presently intact peatlands, e.g. for bioenergy production. Here, we present the first quantitative model-based projections of future peatland dynamics and associated GHG emissions in the context of a 2 °C mitigation pathway. Our spatially explicit land-use modelling approach with global coverage simultaneously accounts for future food demand, based on population and income projections, and land-based mitigation measures. Without dedicated peatland policy and even in the case of peatland protection, our results indicate that the land system would remain a net source of CO2 throughout the 21st century. This result is in contrast to the outcome of current mitigation pathways, in which the land system turns into a net carbon sink by 2100. However, our results indicate that it is possible to reconcile land use and GHG emissions in mitigation pathways through a peatland protection and restoration policy. According to our results, the land system would turn into a global net carbon sink by 2100, as projected by current mitigation pathways, if about 60% of present-day degraded peatlands would be rewetted in the coming decades, next to the protection of intact peatlands. © 2020 The Author(s).

Here we present results from a comparative analysis that examined mitigation options for British Columbia's forest sector. Mitigation scenarios were evaluated using a systems perspective that takes into account the changes in emissions and removals in forest ecosystems, in harvested wood product (HWP) carbon stocks, and in other sectors where wood products substitute for emission-intensive materials and fossil fuels. All mitigation activities were assessed relative to a forward-looking 'business as usual' baseline for three implementation levels. In addition to quantifying net GHG emission reductions, we assessed economic, and socio-economic impacts as well as other environmental indicators relating to forest species, age class, deadwood availability and future timber supply. We further considered risks of reversal for land-based scenarios, by assessing impacts of increasing future wildfires on stands that were not harvested. Results: Our spatially explicit analyses of forest sector mitigation options demonstrated a cost-effective portfolio of regionally differentiated scenarios that directed more of the harvested wood to longer-lived wood products, stopped burning of harvest residues and instead produced bioenergy to displace fossil fuel burning, and reduced harvest levels in regions with low disturbance rates. Domestically, net GHG emissions were reduced by an average of -9 MtCO2e year-1 over 2020-2050 for a portfolio of mitigation activities at a default implementation level, with about 85% of the GHG emission reductions achieved below a cost of $50/tCO2e. Normalizing the net GHG reduction by changes in harvested wood levels permitted comparisons of the scenarios with different ambition levels, and showed that a 1 MtCO2 increase in cumulative harvested stemwood results in a 1 MtCO2e reduction in cumulative emissions, relative to the baseline, for the Higher Recovery scenario in 2070. Conclusions: The analyses conducted in this study contribute to the global understanding of forest sector mitigation options by providing an integrated framework to synthesize the methods, assumptions, datasets and models needed to quantify mitigation activities using a systems approach. An understanding of economically feasible and socio-economically attractive mitigation scenarios along with trade offs for environmental indicators relating to species composition and age, helps decision makers with long-term planning for land sector contributions to GHG emission reduction efforts, and provides valuable information for stakeholder consultations. © 2020 The Author(s).","British Columbia; Climate change mitigation; Cost per tonne; Forest sector; GCBM; Socio-economic impact","carbon sequestration; climate change; cost analysis; environmental impact assessment; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; pollution tax; British Columbia; Canada","Smyth, C.E.; Natural Resources Canada, 506 Burnside Road West, Canada; email: Carolyn.Smyth@Canada.ca",,"BioMed Central Ltd",17500680,,,,"English","Carbon Balance Manage.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092349231

However, while the field is rich with case studies, methods that provide rich data across municipalities and potentially at global scale remain underdeveloped, and comparative insights remain scarce. Here we summarize contributions to the focus issue on 'Systematizing and Upscaling Urban Climate Solutions', also drawing from presentations given at an accompanying conference in 2018. We highlight four core areas for systematizing and upscaling urban climate mitigation solutions. First, with more and better (big) data and associated machine learning methods, there is increasing potential to compare types of cities and leverage collective understanding. Second, while urban climate assessments have mostly emphasized urban planning, demand-side action as related to both behavioral change and modified social practices relevant to urban space deserve more academic attention and integration across a diverse set of social sciences. Third, climate mitigation would be intangible as a single objective at the urban scale, and measures and solutions that coordinate mitigation coherently with adaptation and broader sustainable development goals require explicit conceptualization and systematization. Forth, all insights should come together to develop governance frameworks that translate scientific exercises into concrete, realistic and organized action plans on the ground, for all cities. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this context, there has been a considerable body of research emphasis on reducing the Urban Heat Island (UHI) phenomenon via the resurfacing of public spaces, streets and roofs, with vegetation and cool materials. At the time of writing, minor attention has been given to how buildings' façades could affect outdoor temperature ranges. Whereas facades are studied according to their capabilities of reducing building energy demand and grant indoor comfort, but scarce attention has been given to how their surfaces properties are affecting local microclimates. The proposed work thus assesses the thermal mitigation potential of façades properties such as windows to wall ratios and finishes attribute, such as reflectivity and emissivity. The study, starting from the definition and calibration of a Ladybug Tools' simulation workflow for the assessment of outdoor comfort conditions, simulates urban canyons located in three climate types (temperate warm, temperate cold, and tropical arid), parametrises façade types, along with canyon aspect ratios and ground thermal properties. By creating a hierarchy of importance of interventions between aspect ratios, ground and façade finishes, the work offers information useful to foster site-specific climate mitigation plans. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Façade; Ladybug Tools; Mean radiant temperature; Mitigation; Outdoor comfort; Urban microclimate","Aspect ratio; Atmospheric temperature; Building energy demands; Building facades; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Indoor comforts; Outdoor comforts; Outdoor temperature; Urban heat island; Climate change","Fiorito, F.; Department of Civil, Italy; email: francesco.fiorito@poliba.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087776401

Implemented mitigation measures should ideally be cost-effective, but perfectly ranking alternative nutrient mitigation measures according to cost-effectiveness is a difficult methodological challenge. Furthermore, a particularly practical challenge is that cost-effective measures are not necessarily favoured by local stakeholders, and this may impede their successful implementation in practice. The objective of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of mitigation measures using a methodology that includes a participatory process and social learning to ensure their successful implementation. By combining cost data, hydrological modelling and a bottom-up approach for three different European catchment areas (the Latvian Berze, the Swedish Helge and the German Selke rivers), the cost-effectiveness of 16 nutrient mitigation measures were analysed under current conditions as well as under selected scenarios for future climate and land-use changes. Fertiliser reduction, wetlands, contour ploughing and municipal wastewater treatment plants are the measures that remove nutrients with the highest cost-effectiveness in the respective case study context. However, the results suggest that the cost-effectiveness of measures not only depends on their design, specific location and the conditions of the surrounding area, but is also affected by the future changes the area may be exposed to. Climate and land-use changes do not only affect the cost-effectiveness of measures, but also shape the overall nutrient loads and potential target levels in a catchment. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Baltic sea region; Cost-effectiveness; HYPE Catchment model; Nutrient mitigation; Participatory approach; Water quality","fertilizer; catchment; climate change; cost analysis; land use change; participatory approach; plowing; social behavior; stakeholder; wastewater treatment plant; Article; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; economic aspect; land use; municipal wastewater; nutrient loading; participatory management; plowing; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; river; social learning; waste component removal; waste water management; wetland; climate; climate change; river; Sweden; Climate; Climate Change; Nutrients; Rivers; Sweden","Carolus, J.F.; Department of Food and Resource Economics, Rolighedsvej 25, Denmark; email: johannes.carolus@thuenen.de",,"Academic Press",03014797,,JEVMA,"32579528","English","J.

Hence, the aim of this study was to examine the carbon stock potential of woody species and how it varies by community types and topographic aspects, along altitudinal and slope gradients in Sirso moist evergreen Afromontane vegetation ecosystem of southern Ethiopia. To collect data, a systematic sampling procedure was employed. Five transects were laid out across altitudinal gradients which aligned parallel at 2 km intervals, and 50 sample plots (20 m × 20 m) were laid along transects at 100 m altitudinal interval. Carbon stock was estimated based on the equations and conversion factors formulated for tropical forest carbon stock measurement. The results showed that the total carbon stock of woody species in Sirso moist evergreen Afromontane forest was 384.44 ton/ha. The carbon stock of woody species varied among community types, along altitudinal and slope gradients, while topographic aspect had no significant effect. The carbon stock was higher for the community type of Dracaena fragrans–Rytigynia neglecta, for mid-altitude (1934–2319 m.a.s.l.), and upper slope class (58–75%). Schefflera abyssinica, Syzygium guineense, and Ficus sur contributed 49% of the total carbon stock. Our study suggests that selecting a certain forest as the mitigation option for climate change needs to consider the determinants including vegetation composition and topographic features such as altitude and slope gradients. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Biomass; Carbon stock; Climate change mitigation; Determinant","climate change; evergreen forest; topographic effect; tropical forest; woody plant; Ethiopia; Ficus sur; Rytigynia; Schefflera; Syzygium guineense","Mewded, B.; Forest and Rangeland Biodiversity Directorate, P.O.

In Central Java, Indonesia, ratoon rice is local wisdom in farming called Singgang. Nowadays, almost no farmers are implementing ratoon rice farming, in spite of many advantages for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The objectives of this research are to identify and to map out the current implementation of ratoon rice farming in Central Java; and to formulate the strategies to develop the ratoon rice farming as local wisdom in Central Java. This research was conducted from November 2019 to January 2020, using qualitative research with the FGD method. The research location was chosen by purposive sampling according to three irrigation systems, namely: rainfed rice field in Gondangrejo, Karanganyar Regency; Tidal rice field in Tuntang, Semarang Regency; and technical irrigation rice field in Kebonagung, Demak Regency. The data obtained were analyzed using the SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Opportunities and Threats technique). The results showed that the highest potential to develop ratoon rice farming in Central Java is on rainfed land. Development of ratoon rice for climate change adaptation and mitigation is influenced by the characteristics of farmers, environmental conditions, irrigation systems, the activity of extension workers and farmer groups, the motivation of farmers to innovate. Therefore, the strategies suggested to develop the system are: to increase the role of extension workers and farmer groups, as well as agricultural production facilities, so that the motivation to maintain the local wisdom and accept technological innovations raise; and to minimize the decline in ratoon rice production by intensive farming management and specifically create ratoon rice farming area. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Human resource management; Irrigation; Motivation; Agricultural productions; Central Java Province; Climate change adaptation; Environmental conditions; Farming management; Irrigation systems; Qualitative research; Technological innovation; Climate change","Widiani Priswita, R.P.; Environmental Science Graduated School, Indonesia; email: rahaput97@gmail.com",,"IOP Publishing Ltd",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

The scale and scope of transformational change required across sectors and actors in society raises critical questions of feasibility. Much of the literature on mitigation pathways addresses technological and economic aspects of feasibility, but overlooks the behavioral, cultural, and social factors that affect theoretical and practical mitigation pathways. We present a tripartite framework that “unpacks” the concept of mitigation pathways by distinguishing three factors that together determine actual mitigation: technical potential, initiative feasibility, and behavioral plasticity. The framework aims to integrate and streamline heterogeneous disciplinary research traditions toward a more comprehensive and transparent approach that will facilitate learning across disciplines and enable mitigation pathways to more fully reflect available knowledge. We offer three suggestions for integrating the tripartite framework into current research on climate change mitigation. Most research on pathways to mitigating climate change has concentrated on technological and economic aspects of feasibility with limited consideration of the behavioral, cultural, and social factors that also affect the feasibility of mitigation.

In subtropical and hot-humid climates, typically cooling is required in buildings year round to maintain a comfortable indoor environment. The reduction of energy consumption, in turn, reducing the production of greenhouse gases can be achieved through effective operation of the built environment. In order to move forward with the mitigation of climate change, the impacts of rapid urbanisation need to be-offset. Eco-roofs are one way to achieve this. The aim of this study is to report the energy and cost savings, and achieving environmental benefits of the implementation of eco-roofs in subtropical climates. Eco-roofs use plants to improve roofs performance, appearance or both. They fall into two main categories, which are intensive and extensive green roofs. In this study, an extensive rooftop greenery setup was used for experimental data collection and comparison with non-green roofs setup in a subtropical and hot-humid climate. From the experimental data, it was found that the eco-roofs reduced the cooling load by approximately 13.5% in such climate. © 2020 IEEE.","building energy and monetary savings; environmental benefits; mitigation of climate change; Rooftop greenery systems; subtropical climate","Ecology; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roofs; Sustainable development; Tropics; Built environment; Consumption of energy; Energy and cost savings; Environmental benefits; Extensive green roofs; Hot humid climate; Indoor environment; Subtropical climates; Climate change",,,"Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.",,9781728156415,,,"English","Int.

When the climate change indicators are very visible in the region, many-sided concerns upshot thereby, especially encircling the species composition change, biodiversity loss, frequent environmental stresses, food security, landslides, snowstorms, agro-biodiversity, livelihood and human health. Other than the general footprints, climate change negatively impacts the overall performance of the plants either directly or indirectly by changing the intensity and frequency of abiotic stress factors. As diverse plant species growing in higher altitudes of the region are open to very unfavourable and harsh conditions, especially low temperature, these provide insights into different adaptive mechanisms for abiotic stress tolerance and can be dissected for the same. From time to time, efforts have been made to develop stress resilient crops or climate smart agriculture. A holistic approach comprising the fields of agricultural biotechnology, socio-cultural integrity and crop ecology is going to provide an excellent insight into climate change mitigation strategies and plant abiotic stress tolerance mechanisms in the delicate ecosystem. Moreover, to finely strategize the conservation laws and policies and also for bio prospecting activities, a comprehensive knowledge on abiotic stresses associated with climate change and the counter responses of Himalayan flora is critical. © 2020 Indian National Science Academy.

This study projects the agricultural water use towards 2030 under the climate change mitigation target at the provincial level in China by linking a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model and a regression model. By solving the endogeneities amongst agricultural water use, output and climate factors, we explore how these variables affect water use and further predict future trends through soft-link with the IMED|CGE model. It is found that sunshine duration has a slightly positive impact on water use. Furthermore, agricultural output will significantly drive agricultural water use based on historical data of the past 16 years. Results also show that carbon reduction would have a trade-off or co-benefit effect on water use due to regional disparity. Provinces with increasing agricultural exports, such as Xinjiang and Ningxia, would anticipate considerable growth in agricultural water use induced by carbon reduction.

Little is known about the comparative characteristics of these interventions, including their relative efficacy, potentials and emissions reductions. A more systematic understanding is required to delineate the urban mitigation space and inform decision-making. Here, we utilize bibliometric methods and machine learning to meta-analyze 5635 urban case studies of climate change mitigation. We identify 867 studies that explicitly consider technological or policy instruments, and categorize these studies according to policy type, sector, abatement potential, and socio-technological composition to obtain a first heuristic of what is their pattern. Overall, we find 41 different urban solutions with an average GHG abatement potential ranging from 5.2% to 105%, most of them clustering in the building and transport sectors. More than three-fourth of the solutions are on demand side. Less than 10% of all studies were ex-post policy evaluations. Our results demonstrate that technology-oriented interventions in urban waste, transport and energy sectors have the highest marginal abatement potential, while system-wide interventions, e.g. urban form related measures have lower marginal abatement potential but wider scope. We also demonstrate that integrating measures across urban sectors realizes synergies in GHG emission reductions. Our results reveal a rich evidence of techno-policy choices that together enlarge the urban solutions space and augment actions currently considered in global assessments of climate mitigation. © 2020 The Author(s).

Documentation on these roles is lacking. We quantified the organic C concentration (Corg) and soil physical properties in a mountainous landscape in Sulawesi (Indonesia) for five land cover types: secondary forest (SF), multistrata cocoa-based agroforestry (CAF) aged 4-5 years (CAF4), 10-12 years (CAF10), 17-34 years (CAF17), and multistrata (mixed fruit and timber) agroforest (MAF45) aged 45-68 years. With four replicate plots per cover type, we measured five pools of C-stock according to IPCC guidelines, soil bulk density (BD), macro porosity (MP), hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and available water capacity of the soil (AWC). The highest C-stock, in SF, was around 320 Mg ha-1, the lowest, 74 Mg ha-1, was in CAF4, with the older agroforestry systems being intermediate with 120 to 150 Mg ha-1. Soil compaction after forest conversion led to increased BD and reduced MP, Ks, and AWC. Older agroforestry partly recovered buffering: AWC per m of rooted soil profile increased by 5.7 mm per unit (g kg-1) increase of Corg. The restored AWC can support about a week's worth of evapotranspiration without rain, assisting in climate change adaptation. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate adaptation; Cocoa agroforestry; Inceptisols; Soil macro-porosity; Soil organic carbon; Soil restoration; Soil water availability",,"Gusli, S.; Department of Soil Science, Indonesia; email: sikstusgusli@unhas.ac.id",,"MDPI AG",2073445X,,,,"English","Land",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091904947

However, the differences in characteristics of climate change mitigation and adaptation have shown the possible reasons for a dichotomy in climate policy. This has motivated us to further look into whether cities could integrate their actions in climate change mitigation and adaptation in their planning and how they achieve benefits to overcome the dichotomy. To answer our research question, we have developed an analysis framework built on the endogenous risk theory to analyse how cities overcome the different characteristics to integrate their climate strategies and obtain benefits. The theory of endogenous risk involves seeing both climate change mitigation and adaptation as risk reduction strategies because both of them aim to reduce climate risks and can be carried out by actors who perceive such risks. Therefore, the actors will be more willing to integrate and implement both mitigation and adaptation policy. Our results show that mitigation and adaptation in cities are interlinked and that benefits of an integrated climate change policy exist. A list of entry points how cities overcome the dichotomy are also identified. Our research outcomes also provide a list of benefits identified by the cities in their integrated climate strategies and we call for more public disclosed data for future research and policy assessments. © 2020 by the authors.","Benefits; Cities; Climate change adaptation; Mitigation; Risks","adaptive management; climate change; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; strategic approach; urban area","Guenther, E.; Sustainability Management and Environmental Accounting, Germany; email: ema@mailbox.tu-dresden.de",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091367000

For Austrian cities, depending on location and topography, heavy rainfall events, storms and heat waves in particular could become increasingly relevant in the tourism context. For medium-sized and large cities, heat is the most frequently discussed topic in connection with possible adaptation potentials. The analysis of challenges shows a strong overlap of adaptation targets in city tourism with adaptation challenges for city planning including connection to the sub-urban surrounding areas to confront climate change impacts. Covid-19 pandemic, additionally, offered the opportunity to discuss a new re-start of the city-tourism against the experience during the shutdown period in spring 2020. The paper argues that we can learn from the current health crisis for coping with climate change related extreme events and to increase achievements in climate change mitigation. Firstly, the pandemic provides a strong ability to discuss the impact of city tourism due to short-term air travel and options to enhance more climate-friendly options on the other hand. Secondly, Covid-19 emphasized the need to reconsider the role of free spaces in metropolitan areas as well as their accessibility. Herewith synergies with climate change adaptation are likely when questioning the availability and accessibility of green and blue infrastructure as well as their capacities. Challenges including crowding and impacts by over tourism on public free spaces will require joint strategies involving all public and private institutions (including local communities and businesses) responsible for the maintenance of green and blue free spaces. Thirdly, the strong interactions between urban and suburban areas became evident once more, which will also be very relevant for city tourism in the future (e.g. in times of heat waves). Reflection on the transferability of coping with such crowding effects, related to the adaptive behaviour of residents and tourists in times of severe heat waves, might be relevant for both city tourism and summer tourism destinations near metropolitan areas. Finally, the Covid-19 crisis encourages discussions on over-tourism in metropolitan destinations in favour of a more balanced approach, in particular in inner city areas and around major sightseeing attractions. © 2020 The Authors","City tourism; Climate change adaptation Covid-19 pandemic",,"Jiricka-Pürrer, A.; University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences, Peter-Jordanstraße 82, Austria; email: alexandra.jiricka@boku.ac.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",22130780,,,,"English","J.

To ensure that food systems are sustainable, as well as nourishing, one solution often suggested is to shorten their supply chains toward a regional rather than a global basis. While such regional systems may have a range of costs and benefits, we investigate the mitigation potential of regionalized urban food systems by examining the greenhouse gas emissions associated with food transport. Using data on food consumption for 7108 urban administrative units (UAUs), we simulate total transport emissions for both regionalized and globalized supply chains. In regionalized systems, the UAUs' demands are fulfilled by peripheral food production, whereas to simulate global supply chains, food demand is met from an international pool (where the origin can be any location globally). We estimate that regionalized systems could reduce current emissions from food transport. However, because longer supply chains benefit from maximizing comparative advantage, this emission reduction would require closing yield gaps, reducing food waste, shifting toward diversified farming, and consuming seasonal produce. Regionalization of food systems will be an essential component to limit global warming to well below 2 °C in the future.

We show that blending a well-known technology with recently introduced and proven technical advances can mitigate climate change in the road transport sector. Furthermore, the achievement of a reasonable cost target is proved to be true when internal combustion engines (ICE) light duty vehicles (LDVs), powered by gasoline fuel, are replaced by plug-in hybrid LDVs (PHEV), powered by ethanol and electricity produced from sugarcane, using well established technology. The only improvements in such ethanol producing technology are the addition of woody biomass to extend the operation of sugar mills and the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) generated during sugar fermentation into ethanol. Both actions are already adopted and well developed. The study quantifies greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, expressed as carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions and the present value cost for operation of a global fleet of 1 billion LDV over a 60-year period. The PHEV powered by sugar cane products reduces GHGs emissions partly through negative emissions, at a lower cost than gasoline fueled ICE vehicles or electric vehicles. Total potential GHG emission reduction is significant but lower than what is required for the transport sector to fulfill international commitments. Nevertheless, if 1 billion sugarcane-based PHEV hit the streets by the year 2060, 6.18 Gt CO2e/year can be avoided while the necessity of land for biomass plantation is kept at a reasonable value (86 Mha). © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Negative emissions; Personal transportation; Sugarcane fuels","Bioethanol; Blending; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Internal combustion engines; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Sugar cane; Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Climate change mitigation; Energy services; High energy efficiency; Light duty vehicles; Reasonable value; Road transport sectors; Technical advances; Transport sectors; Climate change; automobile; carbon emission; climate change; combustion; energy efficiency; ethanol; greenhouse gas; road transport; sugar cane; Saccharum","Pacca, S.A.; Sustainability Graduate Program, Brazil; email: spacca@usp.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",13619209,,TRDTF,,"English","Transp.

Such targets imply an expected contribution of afforestation to the net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, yet the nature of afforestation undertaken and its geographical distribution means that there is considerable uncertainty over the eventual emission reductions outcomes. This uncertainty is reduced if the net carbon balance is calculated for all potential afforestation sites, considering climate, soil characteristics and the possible types of afforestation (species and management regimes). To quantify the range of possible emissions outcomes for area-based afforestation targets, a new spatial analysis method was implemented. This improved the integration of spatial data on antecedent land use with mapped outputs from forest models defining the suitability and productivity of eleven forestry management alternatives. This above ground carbon data was then integrated with outputs from the ECOSSE (Estimation of Carbon in Organic Soils – Sequestration and Emissions) model which simulates the soil carbon dynamics. The maps and other model output visualisations combining above and below ground carbon highlight where net carbon surpluses and deficits are likely to occur, how long they persist after afforestation and their relationships with antecedent land use, soils, weather conditions and afforestation management strategies. Using more productive land classes delivers more net sequestration per hectare and could mean greater carbon storage than anticipated by emissions reduction plans. Extensive establishment of lower yielding trees on low-quality ground, with organo-mineral soils could, though, result in net emissions that persist for decades. From the spatial analysis, the range of possible outcomes for any target area of planting is substantial, meaning that outcomes are highly sensitive to policy and implementation decisions on the mix of forestry systems preferred and to spatial targeting or exclusions (both at regional and local scales). The paper highlights the importance of retaining the existing presumption against planting of deep peat areas, but also that additional incentives or constraints may be needed to achieve the aggregate rates of emission mitigation implied by policy commitments. Supplementary carbon storage tonnage targets for new forestry would introduce a floor for carbon sequestration outcomes, but would still allow for flexibility in achieving an appropriate balance in the trade-offs between carbon sequestration and the many other objectives that new woodlands are expected to deliver. © 2020 The Authors","Afforestation; Carbon; Emissions; Mitigation; Soils; Targets","afforestation; carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; forest management; tree planting; woodland","Matthews, K.B.; The James Hutton InstituteUnited Kingdom; email: keith.matthews@hutton.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087005163

Junis 135, Berlin, 10623, Germany","Background. Around two-thirds of global GHG emissions are directly and indirectly linked to household consumption, with a global average of about 6 tCO2eq/cap. The average per capita carbon footprint of North America and Europe amount to 13.4 and 7.5 tCO2eq/cap, respectively, while that of Africa and the Middle East - to 1.7 tCO2eq/cap on average. Changes in consumption patterns to low-carbon alternatives therefore present a great and urgently required potential for emission reductions. In this paper, we synthesize emission mitigation potentials across the consumption domains of food, housing, transport and other consumption. Methods. We systematically screened 6990 records in the Web of Science Core Collections and Scopus. Searches were restricted to (1) reviews of lifecycle assessment studies and (2) multiregional input-output studies of household consumption, published after 2011 in English. We selected against pre-determined eligibility criteria and quantitatively synthesized findings from 53 studies in a meta-review. We identified 771 original options, which we summarized and presented in 61 consumption options with a positive mitigation potential. We used a fixed-effects model to explore the role of contextual factors (geographical, technical and socio-demographic factors) for the outcome variable (mitigation potential per capita) within consumption options. Results and discussion. We establish consumption options with a high mitigation potential measured in tons of CO2eq/capita/yr. For transport, the options with the highest mitigation potential include living car-free, shifting to a battery electric vehicle, and reducing flying by a long return flight with a median reduction potential of more than 1.7 tCO2eq/cap. In the context of food, the highest carbon savings come from dietary changes, particularly an adoption of vegan diet with an average and median mitigation potential of 0.9 and 0.8 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. Shifting to renewable electricity and refurbishment and renovation are the options with the highest mitigation potential in the housing domain, with medians at 1.6 and 0.9 tCO2eq/cap, respectively. We find that the top ten consumption options together yield an average mitigation potential of 9.2 tCO2eq/cap, indicating substantial contributions towards achieving the 1.5 C-2 C target, particularly in high-income context. © 2020 The Author(s).

Different responses have emerged to intervene in these communities and slum upgrading is currently considered the best framework. How slum upgrading interventions engage with climate change adaptation and mitigation is not fully explored in the literature. This article scrutinizes three recent slum upgrading programs in Latin America to uncover the ways these tend to engage or not with climate change adaptation and mitigation. The analysis revealed that slum upgrading is both a policy mechanism to address socio-economic issues and an instrument by which built-environment interventions can enhance adaptation and mitigation in informal settlements. Six key areas emerged from the analysis of the case studies that link slum upgrading to climate change adaptation and mitigation through infrastructure and policies: (1) security of tenure, (2) relocation and barriers, (3) public space, (4) energy-efficient and improved architecture, (5) connectivity, and (6) land management. Slum upgrading can be an effective mechanism that combines mitigation and adaptation efforts whilst addressing sustainable development priorities in disadvantaged territories. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation and mitigation; Climate change; Informal settlements; Latin America; Paris agreement; Slum upgrading","adaptive management; climate change; informal settlement; socioeconomic conditions; Latin America","Wang, H.-H.; Department of Civil Engineering, No. 300, Jhongda Road, Jhongli Dist., Taiwan; email: hhwang@ncu.edu.tw",,"Elsevier Ltd",02642751,,,,"English","Cities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085753562

The Covenant of Mayors (CoM) has been an unprecedented phenomenon in the arena of transnational initiatives in climate action at local level. The initiative has expanded tremendously over the past 10 years, covering more than 9 600 local authorities and 327 million inhabitants as of June 2019. This study analyses policies and measures adopted and implemented by local authorities, signatories to the CoM, as reported in their Monitoring Emission Inventories (MEI). More than 12 000 policies reported in 315 MEIs have been assessed. The policies adopted in municipalities across Europe have been classified according to two criteria: (1) the type of policy tool and (2) the field of action. The aggregated policies have then be correlated with the grouping of signatories according to three “contextual” drivers. The contextual drivers allow identifying the factors that may influence the distribution of climate and energy policies and successful examples and methodologies that may be replicated in other cities with comparable characteristics and similar contexts. Overall, results show that the most common policies cover municipal assets and structures. The policies adopted by local governments do change with the population and, therefore, the focus on municipal assets changes with the increase of population, while local authorities’ Gross Domestic Products and climatic conditions have limited influence on the selection and distribution of policies in the framework of this study. © 2020 The Author(s)","Cities; Covenant of Mayors; Dataset; MEI; Mitigation; Policies","Climate change mitigation; Climatic conditions; Emission inventories; Gross domestic products; Local authorities; Local government; Municipal assets; Policies and measures; Climate change","Palermo, V.; European Commission, Via Enrico Fermi 2749, I, Italy; email: valentina.palermo@ec.europa.eu",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085653194

Therefore, the efforts to integrate these two approaches have been made by the political arrangements to seek the synergy effects and deal with trade-offs. To study the state of the art linkages and forest policies to realize both adaptation and mitigation, we systematically review the literature highlighting the topic (136 publications) and outline two different approaches from Germany and Japan as countries with substantial forest resources and high influences on international forest policies and wood trade. We identify three linkages: (1) an ecosystem (based) approach assuming that a resilient ecosystem (adaptation), has high potential as a carbon sink (mitigation), (2) a sustainable forest management (SFM) aiming for enhancing forests’ resilience and carbon sink potential simultaneously, and (3) a cross-sectoral approach generating synergies among multiple sectors of agriculture, forestry, urban design, and nature conservation. We find that a significant objective is still SFM for sustaining the forest area andwood production, where SFM examples in Germany and Japan exemplify contributions to carbon sinks and ongoing disaster risk management, respectively. Overall, the current differentiated objectives of SFM do not underpin the twofold approach and their synergy effects. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Despite their importance in wildfire management, the nature of future changes to prescribed burn windows under global warming remains uncertain. We use a regional climate projection ensemble to provide a robust spatiotemporal quantification of statistically significant future changes in prescribed burn windows for southeastern Australia. There are significant decreases during months presently used for prescribed burning, that is, in March to May in 2060–2079 versus 1990–2009 across several temperate regions. Conversely, burn windows show widespread significant increases in June to August, that is, months when burns have rarely occurred historically, and also in spring (September–October). Overall, projected changes in temperature and fuel moisture show the most widespread and largest decreases (or increases) in the number of days within their respective ranges suitable for conducting burns.

Brown seaweeds of the genus Sargassum are the largest canopy-forming algae in tropical and subtropical environments, with a wide global distribution on rocky reefs and as floating stands. Because these algae present high amounts of biomass, we suggest their contribution is relevant for global carbon stocks and consequently for mitigating climate change as CO2 remover. We modelled global distributions and quantified carbon stocks as above-ground biomass (AGB) with machine learning algorithms and climate data. Sargassum AGB totaled 13.1 Pg C at the global scale, which is a significant amount of carbon, comparable to other key marine ecosystems, such as mangrove forests, salt marshes and seagrass meadows. However, specific techniques related to bloom production and management, or the utilization of biomass for biomaterials, should be fostered. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Above ground biomass; Carbon stocks; Climate change; Distribution and biomass modelling; Sargassum","Algae; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystems; Forestry; Geographical distribution; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Tropics; Above ground biomass; Brown seaweed; Climate change mitigation; Coastal systems; Global distribution; Mangrove forest; Natural carbons; Seagrass meadows; Climate change; biomaterial; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon; aboveground biomass; biomass; bioremediation; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; coastal zone; marine ecosystem; mitigation; reef; rocky shore; seaweed; Article; biomass production; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; machine learning; mangrove; marine environment; photosynthesis; priority journal; salt marsh; Sargassum; seagrass; seaweed; tropic climate; biomass; forest; tree; algae; Sargassum; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Forests; Sargassum; Trees; Tropical Climate","Gouvêa, L.P.; Phycology Laboratory, Brazil; email: lidi_pel@hotmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"32498159","English","Sci.

CO2 capture and storage (CCS) in geological formations, specifically in deep saline aquifers, is among the very promising strategies to control and mitigate emissions into the atmosphere. Injection of CO2 into a reservoir may result in the formation of pore pressure which can initiate cracks and trigger fault activities. CO2 may leak into the atmosphere and invade shallow groundwater sources. Release of CO2 into the atmosphere has enormous effects on the environment and significantly contributes to global climate change. Therefore, storage safety, injection efficiency, and monitoring remain crucially important considerations in CO2 injection. This study attempts to establish an optimal CO2 injection strategy that aims at enhancing CO2 storage with an increased safety at Ordos basin. Furthermore, it establishes the safety limits of CO2 plume migration from the central axis of the injection well. In the investigation, injection parameters such as injection rate and bottom hole pressure were analyzed. The CO2 plume migration analysis was performed, and migration limits were determined. Simulation results revealed that different formation layers have varying storage capacities and pressure withstanding ability. The site maximum storage rate goal of storing 100,000 t of CO2 per year was attained. It is advised to perform injection at the Majiagou layer due to sufficient storage capacity and greater depth of over 2400 m from the surface. This study recommends that an optimum CO2 sequestration strategy which does not result into excessive migration of injected CO2 plume and limit formation pressure buildup should be adopted. Therefore, deep underground storage at an average depth of above 2400 m is optimum, because it has an adequate storage space to accommodate the desired rate of 100,000 t/year. Besides, its geological settings favor storage safety in the event of significant uplift that may cause induced seismicity. Furthermore, it will also limit CO2 plume that may come into contact with shallow groundwater sources. Likewise, investing in low carbon and carbon-free energy technologies and enhancement of energy efficiency systems around the site is also recommended. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Anthropogenic CO2; Climate change; CO2 storage; Injection strategy; Numerical simulation","anthropogenic effect; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; combustion; energy efficiency; fossil fuel; groundwater resource; numerical model; pore pressure; seismicity; underground storage; China; Ordos Basin","Mkemai, R.M.; Department of Petroleum Engineering, China; email: mkemai2000@yahoo.com",,"Springer",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

Some studies have assessed such relationships, but the degree of such interaction remains poorly understood. Here, we show the SDG implications associated with CO2 emissions reductions. We developed 'marginal SDG-emissions-reduction values (MSVs)', which represent the marginal impacts on SDG indicators caused by a unit CO2 emissions reduction. This metric is applicable to national assessments and was applied to Asia. We found clear relationships between CO2 emissions reduction rates and many SDG targets. For instance, 1% reduction of CO2 can avoid 0.57% of air pollution-related premature deaths (SDG3), whereas the mean species richness (SDG15) is decreased by 0.026% with the same reduction (not including climate change impacts). Our findings are useful for assessing the SDG implications associated with CO2 emissions reduction targets, which will help inform national climate policies. © 2020 The Author(s).

The flame curtain technology has been tested on a limited range of ligno-cellulosic biomass; therefore, this study explored the operation and performance of earth (EKT) and metal (MKT) Kon-Tiki kilns using abundantly available tropical oil palm frond (OPF). The apparent carbon sequestration potential (CSP) was estimated based on the H/Corgratio method. Our results demonstrated that both kilns reached highest treatment temperatures of 790±100 °C(EKT) and 792±44 °C(MKT) (p=0.98) and exhibited a sinus wave-like temperature profile in the case of MKT. The average biochar yield produced from both kilns was 16±4wt. % with a fixed carbon and ash content of 56±3wt. % and 27±3wt. %, respectively. The OPF biochar had a pH of 10.02±0.04 with a liming capacity of 8.91±0.17 % calcium carbonate equivalent. The molar H/C and O/C ratios were 0.45±0.03 and 0.19±0.09, both satisfying IBI and EBC criteria for biochar. OPF biochars were mesoporous (&lt; 50nm) with a BET (N2) surface area of 180-190m2/g. OPF biochar had an average CSP of 0.27±0.04 kgCO2/kgOPF. Biochar production cost was estimated to be 177 and 335 USD /t for EKT and MKT respectively.

The use of renewable energy sources increases energy security and enables countries to achieve their climate mitigation goals. Ecuador’s energy mix is dominated using fossil fuels and produces only 7.8% of its energy supply from renewable energy. The scenario analysis suggests that using the example of international renewable energy policies will achieve sustainable energy development in Ecuador. Relying less on fossil fuels and decentralizing the electricity sector from the use of thermoelectric plants is the great challenge for the country. Using the enormous water potential that Ecuador has and taking advantage of the sources of solar, biomass and wind energy available in the country will reduce the forecast of 60,233.70 KT CO2 by 2030 that would be reached if current consumption conditions and energy mix are maintained, while designing a long-term energy planning with a greater participation of renewable energies would forecast a CO2 emission of 41,232.30 KT, that is, a reduction of 31.5% in emissions. © 2020 by the authors.

While woody encroachment is commonly considered as a climate change mitigation measure, studies suggest a still uncertain role of the soil organic carbon (SOC) pool in contributing to climate change mitigation during this process. Therefore, the objective of the study is to investigate the possible SOC variations occurring as a consequence of the secondary succession process at the provincial level in an Alpine area in Italy. Materials and Methods: A chronosequence approach was applied to identify, in five different study areas of the Belluno province, the land use/land cover change over four different stages of natural succession, from managed grazing land to secondary forest developed on abandoned grazing land. In each chronosequence stage, soil samples were collected down to the bedrock (0-60 cm depth) to determine the changes in the SOC stock due to the woody encroachment process. Results: In all areas, small or no significant (p < 0.05) SOC stock changes were observed during the secondary succession in the upper 30 cm of mineral soil, while significant changes were evident in the 30-60 cm compartment, with the SOC stock significantly decreasing from 30% to 60% in the final stage of the succession. This fact indicates the great importance of considering also the subsoil when dealing with land use/land cover change dynamics. Conclusions: The recorded trend in SOC has been proved to be the opposite in other Italian regions, so our results indicate the importance of local observation and data collection to correctly evaluate the soil contribution to climate change mitigation during woody encroachment. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Common agricultural policy; Rural development program; Soil organic carbon; Woody encroachment","Forestry; Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; Climate change mitigation; Land use/land cover change; Local observations; Natural succession; Secondary forests; Secondary succession; Soil organic carbon; Woody encroachments; Climate change; climate change; Common Agricultural Policy; land cover; mitigation; rural development; soil organic matter; woody plant; Coverings; Data Processing; Forestry; Italian; Land Use; Processes; Soil; Alps; Belluno; Italy; Veneto","Chiti, T.; Department for Innovation in Biological, Italy; email: tommaso.chiti@unitus.it",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090351419

Here, we describe the contribution of inertia to future trends. Drawing from thermodynamic principles, and using 38 years of available statistics between 1980 to 2017, we find a constant scaling between current rates of world primary energy consumption EðtÞ and the historical time integral W of past world inflation-adjusted economic production Y, or WðtÞ ¼ R0t Yðt0Þdt0. In each year, over a period during which both E and W more than doubled, the ratio of the two remained nearly unchanged, that is l ¼ EðtÞðtÞ=WðtÞ ¼ 5:9 * 0:1 Gigawatts per trillion 2010 US dollars. What this near constant implies is that current growth trends in energy consumption, population, and standard of living, perhaps counterintuitively, are determined by past innovations that have improved the economic production efficiency, or enabled use of less energy to transform raw materials into the makeup of civilization. Current observed growth rates agree well with predictions derived from available historical data. Future efforts to stabilize carbon dioxide emissions are likely also to be constrained by the contributions of past innovation to growth. Assuming no further efficiency gains, options look limited to rapid decarbonization of energy consumption through sustained implementation of at least one Gigawatt of renewable or nuclear power capacity per day. Alternatively, with continued reliance on fossil fuels, civilization could shift to a steady-state economy, one that devotes economic production exclusively to maintining ongoing metabolic needs rather than to material expansion. Even if such actions could be achieved immediately, energy consumption would continue at its current level, and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations would only begin to balance natural sinks at concentrations exceeding 500 ppmv. © 2020 Garrett et al.

At the municipal level, multi-stakeholder partnerships are often formed to implement community sustainability plans. However, these partnerships can create new challenges, as it is cumbersome to coordinate action among a group that is made up of such diverse stakeholders. Past research suggests that it is important for these partnerships to have the appropriate structures in place to mitigate some of the coordination challenges to which they are prone. Yet, very few studies have examined the influence that different structural features have on plan outcomes. This article seeks to address this important research gap by using quantitative methods to examine five different features that can compose partnership structures-oversight, monitoring and evaluation, partner engagement, communication, and community wide-actions and their impact on climate change mitigation outcomes. Based on data collected through a global survey and publicly available greenhouse gases emission data from 72 different partnerships that implement community sustainability plans (CSPs), this study finds that structural features related to oversight and community-wide actions are positively associated with climate change mitigation outcomes. These results indicate that certain features of partnership structures may be more important for achieving desirable climate change mitigation outcomes, and thus contribute to research on collaborative governance structures and climate action. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate action; Climate change; Climate mitigation; Collaboration; Collective action; Cross-sector partnership; Local Agenda 21; SDG 17; Sustainable communities; Urban sustainability","action plan; business; climate change; governance approach; greenhouse gas; mitigation; participatory approach; partnership approach; policy implementation; research work; stakeholder; sustainability","Clarke, A.; School of Environment, Canada; email: amelia.clarke@uwaterloo.ca",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089395051

Currently, if climate change enters the arena of public debate, it primarily does so in direct relation to the pandemic. In two experiments, we investigated (1) whether portraying the response to the COVID-19 threat as a “trial run” for future climate action would increase climate-change concern and mitigation support, and (2) whether portraying climate change as a concern that needs to take a “back seat” while focus lies on economic recovery would decrease climate-change concern and mitigation support. We found no support for the effectiveness of a trial-run frame in either experiment. In Experiment 1, we found that a back-seat frame reduced participants’ support for mitigative action. In Experiment 2, the back-seat framing reduced both climate-change concern and mitigation support; a combined inoculation and refutation was able to offset the drop in climate concern but not the reduction in mitigation support. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate action; Climate change communication; COVID-19; Framing; Mitigation support",,"Ecker, U.K.H.; School of Psychological Science, 35 Stirling Hwy, Australia; email: ullrich.ecker@uwa.edu.au",,"Academic Press",02724944,,JEPSE,,"English","J.

We focus on a set of UK habitats of recognised conservation value, first quantifying the carbon stored in the vegetation and top 30 cm of soil in these areas. We estimate that these areas store 0.55 gigatonnes of carbon in vegetation and soil to a depth of 30 cm, approximately 30% of the UK terrestrial carbon store to a similar depth, on 20% of the land area. Most of these high carbon, high conservation value habitats are in upland areas, with particularly notable extents and mass of carbon in Scotland. In their current condition, we estimate these areas to exert a net sequestration effect of more than 8 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year. Furthermore, restoration of these habitats from their current, generally poor condition could result in an extra 6–7 million tonnes of CO2 equivalents per year, in the context of the UK's total emissions of 455.9 million tonnes CO2eq in 2017.

In addition, increasingly warmer water temperatures are likely to shift the habitat ranges of many fish and shellfish species, ultimately disrupting ecosystems. In general, climate change will probably have negative implications for farming, animal husbandry and fishing.

The complexness of climate change makes it difficult to predict relationships and formulate policies across varied countries. Motivated by the core mandate of the Kyoto Protocol, we examined the individual, combined and interactive impact of growth in income, renewable energy, foreign direct investment, and governance on greenhouse gas emissions. We decomposed the relationships to account for the theories of scale effect, composition effect and technique effect. The study utilized a dynamic heterogeneous estimation technique with a panel data from 1990 to 2017 in 47 Sub-Saharan African countries. Our adopted empirical framework made it possible to account for heterogeneity, a situation that may be prevalent in countries with varied economic and environmental policies. The empirical results revealed that increasing the share of renewable energy by 1% declines greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 35.32% (95% Confidence interval) while a 1% increase in the coupling effect of income level, governance, and renewable energy consumption intensifies climate change by 0.79%. The interactive effects of scale, composition, and technique indicators were found to worsen climate change. The decoupling effect revealed that while foreign direct investment, income level, and governance exacerbate climate change, renewable energy consumption lessens climate change and its impact. From a policy perspective, the magnitude of the technique effect of renewable energy consumption depends on, inter alia, its share in the energy portfolio, technological innovation, and country-specific policy instruments. The study demonstrated that decoupling renewable energy from economic growth propels the transition from fossil fuels, leading to energy efficiency— explaining the decline in GHG emissions. © 2020 The Author(s)","Climate change mitigation; Foreign direct investment; Pollution haven hypothesis; Renewable energy; Sub-Saharan African","Composition effects; Economic analysis; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Climate change mitigation; Foreign direct investments; Pollution haven hypothesis; Renewable energies; Sub-Saharan; Investments","Sarkodie, S.A.; Nord University Business School (HHN), Post Box 1490, Norway; email: asumadusarkodiesamuel@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The trigger of such contributions can be traced to Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry (LULUCF). The problem of deforestation is complex, involving social, economic and political sectors. On the other hand, a holistic approach has not been widely discussed and implemented. This paper attempts to review and aims at providing potential answer on how to manage the forest and its relations with people in order to combat forest destruction caused by people. We believed that managing such relationship is the key to maintain the sustainability of the forest while keeping its roles and sustainability. Literature review was employed to develop a problem framework, and to develop alternatives in bridging the relationships between forest and local community. Collecting relevant literatures using keywords such as ""forest and climate change mitigation"", ""agroforestry and climate change"", ""ecotourism and climate change"", and ""agroforestry and ecotourism"", 96 articles were found. Further, through matching the content and the research goals of the articles, 13 articles were selected for further content analysis. We proposed agro-ecotourism as the alternative answer that can be pursued to balance the relationship between forest and people, especially in putting forest as an important partner rather than an exploitable asset. Hence, agro-ecotourism may help to increase the awareness among local community on the critical roles of the forest in the long term to fight against climate changes. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Conservation; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land use; Planning; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Content analysis; Greenhouse emissions; Holistic approach; Land-use change; Literature reviews; Local community; Research goals; Climate change",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Developing strategies to reduce the emissions associated with key global commodities is essential to mitigate the impacts of climate change. To date, however, there have been no studies that have estimated the potential to reduce GHG emissions associated with the production of wheat, a key global commodity, at a national scale through changes to wheat production systems. Here, we assess the consequences for net GHG emissions of Australian wheat production from applying three changes to wheat production systems: increasing the rates of fertiliser N to achieve the water-limited yield potential; increasing the frequency of lime applications on acid soils; and changing a two year cropping rotation (from wheat-wheat to legume-wheat). We predict that applying these three changes across the key wheat growing regions in Australia would increase production of wheat and legumes by 17.8 and 5.3 Mt, respectively, over the two-year period. Intensifying Australian production would reduce the need to produce wheat and legumes elsewhere in the world. This would free up agricultural land at the global scale and avoid the need to convert forestland and grassland to cropping lands to meet increasing global demands for wheat. We find that applying these changes across wheat growing zones would reduce the GHGs associated with Australian wheat production by 18.4 Mt CO2-e over the two-year period. Our research supports the notion that intensification of existing agricultural production can provide climate change mitigation. The impacts of intensification on other environmental indicators also need to be considered by policy makers. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Burden shifting; Indirect land use change; Intensification","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Greenhouse gases; Lime; Soils; Agricultural land; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Developing strategy; Environmental indicators; Increase productions; Research support; Wheat production; Climate change; calcium oxide; nitrogen fertilizer; climate change; crop production; crop rotation; development strategy; emission control; greenhouse gas; wheat; agricultural land; Article; Australia; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; crop production; crop rotation; cropland; forest soil; grassland; harvest; legume; prediction; priority journal; soil acidity; wheat; agriculture; climate change; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; Australia; Triticum aestivum; Agriculture; Australia; Climate Change; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Triticum","Simmons, A.T.; New South Wales Department of Primary Industries, 98 Victoria St, Australia; email: aaron.simmons@dpi.nsw.gov.au",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"32298879","English","Sci.

However, conceptualizing the scale of the solutions required to protect ourselves against global-mean sea level rise aids in our ability to acknowledge and understand that threat. On these grounds, we here discuss a means to protect over 25 million people and important economical regions in northern Europe against sea level rise. We propose the construction of a Northern European Enclosure Dam (NEED) that stretches between France, the United Kingdom, and Norway. NEED may seem an overwhelming and unrealistic solution at first. However, our preliminary study suggests that NEED is potentially favorable financially, but also in scale, impacts, and challenges compared to that of alternative solutions, such as (managed) migrations and that of country-by-country protection efforts. The mere realization that a solution as considerable as NEED might be a viable and cost-effective protection measure is illustrative of the extraordinary global threat of global-mean sea level rise that we are facing. As such, the concept of constructing NEED showcases the extent of protection efforts that are required if mitigation efforts fail to limit sea level rise. ©2020 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Enclosures; Alternative solutions; Climate change mitigation; Cost-effective protection; Global mean sea levels; Global threats; Sea level rise; United kingdom; Sea level","Groeskamp, S.; Department of Ocean Systems, Netherlands; email: sjoerd.groeskamp@nioz.nl",,"American Meteorological Society",00030007,,BAMIA,,"English","Bull.

However, measures such as renovation of residential buildings or installation of micro generation technologies based on renewable energy sources have not realized their full energy saving and GHG emission reduction potentials, due to the energy efficiency paradox and other barriers. These climate change mitigation policies targeting the households sector can deliver extra benefits such as energy poverty reduction and implementation of the energy justice principle; therefore, they require more attention of scholars and policy makers. The aim of this paper is to analyze the energy poverty and climate change mitigation issues in EU households based on a systematic literature review, and to provide future research paths and policy recommendations. Based on the systematic literature review, this paper develops an integrated framework for addressing energy poverty, just carbon free energy transition and climate change mitigation issues in the EU. Additionally, we argue that more targeted climate change policies and measures are necessary in the light of the shortcomings of current measures to reduce energy poverty and realize climate change mitigation potential linked to energy consumption in households. ©2020.","Climate change mitigation; Energy justice; Energy poverty; Energy renovation; Households; Renewable energy sources","Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Free energy; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Emission reduction potentials; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Integrated frameworks; Policy recommendations; Renewable energy source; Systematic literature review; Climate change","Streimikiene, D.; Lithuanian Energy InstituteLithuania; email: dalia.streimikiene@lei.lt

We focus on one of the social dimensions of climate change mitigation: the link between society-wide patience (future orientation) and adoption of public policies to combat global greenhouse gas emissions. Theoretically, future-oriented societies are more likely to accept current costs in exchange for long-run benefits posed by climate change mitigation than impatient (present-oriented) ones, cooperate in efforts to combat climate change, and support future-oriented governments. We evaluate this claim using evidence from a cross-section of countries.

The United Nations have explicitly included the provision of transport infrastructure access, e.g. through all-season road access, in their Sustainable Development Goal agenda (SDGs, target 9.1). Yet, little is known about the number of people lacking access to roads worldwide, the costs of closing existing access gaps and the implications of additional roads for other sustainability concerns such as climate change mitigation (SDG-13). Here we quantify, for 250 countries and territories, the percentage of population without road access in 2 km. We find that infrastructure investments required to provide quasi-universal road access are about USD 3 trillion. We estimate that the associated cumulative CO2 emissions from construction work and additional traffic until the end of the century amount to roughly 16 Gt.

This sector also contributes a third of the annual EU greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Accordingly, construction represents one priority area for intervention within the EU Action Plan for the Circular Economy. Increasing resource efficiency through slowing, closing, and narrowing material and energy loops, is key to mitigating climate change. However, this review paper demonstrates that the analysis of links between circular economy solutions and climate change mitigation has been scarce, despite a recent sharp increase in related literature, with 20 articles (83%) published in 2018–2019. Slowing resource solutions have been the focus of the research and could bring up to 99% savings in GHG emissions per functional unit, where material reuse stands out as the most promising alternative. Closing resource solutions can reduce emissions by 30–50% per functional unit, but results are highly dependent on recycling efficiencies and transportation distances to recovery facilities. Solutions for narrowing resource loops can bring additional GHG savings, but they remain understudied. Despite the promising results for mitigating GHG emissions, this article argues that the circular economy solutions do not always result by default in emission reductions and that a case-by-case quantification is crucial. The implementation of these solutions should be accompanied with further methodological development, such as proper allocation procedures, accurate definition of the system boundaries and integration of forecasts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Closing resource loops; Construction; Greenhouse gases; Narrowing resource loops; Resource efficiency; Slowing resource loops","Construction; Construction industry; Demolition; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Plant shutdowns; Climate change mitigation; Closing resource loops; Construction and demolition waste; Narrowing resource loops; Recycling efficiency; Resource efficiencies; Slowing resource loops; Transportation distance; Climate change","Gallego-Schmid, A.; Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Pariser Building, Sackville Street, United Kingdom; email: alejandro.gallegoschmid@manchester.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

To achieve 2 °C climate targets, many scenarios require tens of gigatons of CO2 stored per year by mid-century. These scenarios are often unconstrained by growth rates, and uncertainty in global geologic storage assessments limits resource-based constraints. Here we show how logistic growth models, a common tool in resource assessment, provide a mathematical framework for stakeholders to monitor short-term CCS deployment progress and long-term resource requirements in the context of climate change mitigation targets. Growth rate analysis, constrained by historic commercial CO2 storage rates, indicates sufficient growth to achieve several of the 2100 storage targets identified in the assessment reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. A maximum global discovered storage capacity of approximately 2700 Gt is needed to meet the most aggressive targets, with this ceiling growing if CCS deployment is delayed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Growth rate; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Climate change mitigation; Geologic carbon storages; Integrated assessment models; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Logistic growth model; Mathematical frameworks; Resource requirements; Climate change","Zahasky, C.; Department of Geoscience, United States; email: czahasky@wisc.edu",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",17545692,,,,"English","Energy Environ.

Providing access to safely managed sanitation may lead to reduced GHG emissions and thus simultaneously address both Sustainable Development Goals. Here we measure cumulative GHG emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) during the off-site composting of human waste to estimate scalable emission factors. We find that CH4 emission factors are one to two orders of magnitude smaller than IPCC values for other excreta collection, treatment and disposal processes. After accounting for GHG emissions throughout the sanitation cycle, including transport, urine and compost end-use, the climate change mitigation potential is 126 kg of CO2-equivalent per capita per year for slum inhabitants. If scaled to global slum populations, composting could mitigate 3.97 Tg CH4 yr−1, representing 13-44% of sanitation sector CH4 emissions. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"anthropogenic source; carbon dioxide; climate change; composting; emission control; global perspective; greenhouse gas; methane; sanitation; Sustainable Development Goal; waste disposal","McNicol, G.; Department of Natural Resources and Environmental Management, United States; email: gmcnicol@stanford.edu",,"Nature Research",1758678X,,,,"English","Nat.

However, the interaction between mitigation, climate migration and poverty has not been investigated explicitly. Here, we represent simultaneous poverty- and climate-induced migration in a laboratory setting, within the collective-risk social dilemma that arises from attempts to avert dangerous climate change. The relatively rich participants try to prevent migration by the relatively poor but in the long run these attempts are unsuccessful because of free-riding among the rich. The rich are willing to increase their effort at averting dangerous climate change when the poor are hit by a climate extreme event exacerbating their poverty. Conversely, the poor are willing to compensate some weaker effort by the rich, as long as the effort by the rich lies above a threshold emerging within the experiment. © 2020, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; economic conditions; extreme event; migration; nature-society relations; poverty","Marotzke, J.; Department ‘The Ocean in the Earth System’, Germany; email: jochem.marotzke@mpimet.mpg.de",,"Nature Research",1758678X,,,,"English","Nat.

We further categorise behaviours into ‘public’ and ‘private’ behaviours and conduct meta-regressions to see whether these categories moderate overall effect sizes. Analysing 141 correlations from 51 studies (46 articles), we find that trust in scientists and trust in environmental groups strongly correlate with climate-friendly behaviours. Meta-regressions further show that trust in institutions is moderately correlated with public behaviours, but only weakly with private behaviours, while associations with trust in industry and general trust measures are weak.

Additionally, a second objective was to identify the potential contribution of the office building stock in relation to New Zealand's 2050 climate change mitigation target. For this purpose, the study used Life Cycle Assessment in conjunction with stock aggregation modelling. The impacts of the building stock were calculated for non- refurbished building stock; refurbished building stock; refurbished building stock adopting resource and waste management measures and; refurbished building stock installed with photovoltaic panels. The results highlight the achievability of New Zealand's 2050 target in the office-building sector with a potential to reduce 40–98 % CO2 eq. emissions. Use of photovoltaic substantially increases the resource demand of refurbished buildings. Prioritizing the refurbishment of the building stock by adopting efficient resource use and waste management measures can contribute to reductions in greenhouse gas emissions without increasing environmental pressures from resource demand.

This integration of agriculture and forestry is frequently seen as an option that can secure food security and co-deliver a range of environmental benefits. However, quantitative studies simultaneously integrating multiple aspects of agroforestry are rare. Focusing on four sustainability goals, namely adaptation to climate change, biodiversity conservation, climate change mitigation and rural development, this study investigated co-benefits and adverse side-effects of shaded agroforests above cocoa, coffee, oil palm, banana and citrus plantations in tropical humid West Africa. Time series of remote sensing land cover datasets were used to quantify and map recent land cover transitions in the region, and a field study in 25 agroforestry plots in Togo provided biomass carbon measurements in over 3000 trees, in addition to local farmers interviews. Estimates of theoretical agroforestry expansion and associated carbon sequestration potential in the region were compared to regional emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation. We found that about 1.6 Mha of losses in evergreen forests occurred between 1992 and 2015 (corresponding to 17% of the forest area originally present in 1992), while agricultural areas increased by 2.4 Mha (+5% relative to 1992). On average, trees in the studied agroforestry plots store 83.7 ± 7.0 t C/ha. We found synergies between rural development and adaptation benefits, no clear relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage, and a trade-off between high carbon stocks and crop yields. This trade-off can be minimized with an optimal management of agroforestry by using a mix of tree species that store medium carbon stocks and can enhance yields, soil fertility and climate resilience. In general, plant functional diversity, i.e. a balanced mix of shade trees, fruit trees, palms and bananas, emerged as a key feature of successful agroforestry systems. Besides, agroforestry trees co-products are reported as an additional, diversified source of income for local farmers. A large-scale deployment of agroforestry over seven countries in West Africa can sequester up to 135 Mt CO2/year over two decades, corresponding to about 166% of the carbon emissions from fossil fuels and deforestation in the region. Overall, agroforestry practices in tropical humid West Africa offer multiple-win solutions that are relevant to address major local and global environmental challenges. Increasing cooperation among local farmer communities, national authorities, and international organizations are instrumental to overcome the barriers for a future expansion of agroforestry systems in the region. © 2020 The Authors","Agroforestry; Climate change mitigation; Co-benefits; Sustainable agriculture; West Africa",,"Tschora, H.; Industrial Ecology Programme, Norway; email: heloise-tschora@laposte.net",,"Elsevier B.V.",23519894,,,,"English","Glob.

We then simulate the propagation of new technological vintages on these networks and quantify the reduction of emissions induced by the diffusion process using a tailored feedback centrality measure labelled “emission centrality”. Finally, we investigate how new forms of international collaboration such as climate clubs can contribute to mitigation by catalysing the adoption of new technologies.

In this paper, we investigate whether or not insights into premodern strategies for coping with climate change—and especially the “deeper histories” of traditional ways-of-knowing—can play a useful role in future planning, management and mitigation efforts. We do this in two ways. First, we assess this special issue's 17 archaeological case studies, in order to determine whether they are conducted within a framework that is consistent with approaches to resilience in studies of modern Arctic communities. Second, we focus on three climate-driven challenges faced by Canadian Arctic Inuit: safe travel, food security and food safety. For each, we identify specific ways in which studies of past social-ecological systems intersect with modern climate adaptation. We conclude that since archaeological insights highlight the operation of decision-making processes within long-term culture-adaptive trajectories, they can offer unique insights into the much shorter-term processes currently underway. While we highlight many potential directions for productive collaboration, much more work is required in local and regional settings to demonstrate the full potential of archaeology for future-oriented planning and mitigation efforts. © 2020","Archaeology; Arctic; Climate change; Food safety; Food security; Human-environment interactions; Indigenous knowledge; Inuit; Long-term; Resilience; Social-ecological systems","adaptive management; arctic environment; climate change; climate variation; coping strategy; environmental planning; future prospect; human settlement; indigenous population; paleoclimate; Arctic; Canada; Canadian Arctic","Desjardins, S.P.A.; Arctic Centre, Netherlands; email: s.p.a.desjardins@rug.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",10406182,,,,"English","Quat.

Through this mechanism, it is expected that the role of the community in forest management will be stronger and the benefits of forests to improve community welfare can be realized. This study aims to determine the impacts of community forestry programs and also to observe further how the community rehabilitates marginal forest areas as an effort to reduce the effects of climate change. Surveys, FGD and interviews to stakeholders and community groups that obtain forest management rights are conducted to collect data. The research-results explain that community-forestry-permit provides a freedom for the community, hence they could manage the land optimally. The implementation of community forestry still requires assistance from local government as a facilitator so that the programs carried out are truly useful and provide optimal results. Furthermore, the establishment of institutions, program design, and planning in the management system also still needs to be strengthened. The term of climate change has not been widely known by the community in rural areas of South Sumatra. However, they have realized the impact of climate change.

This paper investigates potential challenges in implementation of the programs by exploring local community's understanding on the role of mangroves in climate change and their acceptance to the mangrove programs. The results are discussed in the context of theories related to community-based natural resources management and property rights. Survey using questionnaires is followed by in-depth interview and it shows that most respondents understand the importance of mangroves in climate change mitigation but are not well informed about the programs. They are also objected to the land reform and social forestry programs because the programs do not provide comparable compensation. This finding is congruent with the theories of property rights and co-management of natural resources. To increase community's acceptance, legalization of occupied mangrove land, therefore, needs to be followed by other interventions such as awareness raising programs, financial support and market control as extra benefits for the local communities. The central and local governments also need to intensively communicate with the local communities to arrange technical, administrative and political mechanisms in collaborative mangrove management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Deforestation; Natural resources management; Surveys; Timber; Awareness raising; Climate change mitigation; Community based natural resources management; Financial support; Forest degradation; In-depth interviews; Reducing emissions; Social forestries; Climate change","Salminah, M.; Center for Research and Development on Social, Jl Gunung Batu No 5, Indonesia; email: mimiaruman@yahoo.com.sg","SubarudiObidinski K.Rochmayanto Y.Nurfatriani F.Arifanti V.B.Muttaqin Z.Rumboko L.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Measurement of carbon storage was conducted using the allometric formula on an observation plot of 200 m2. Six sampling points were selected consisted of four location with shading trees planted in multistrata agroforestry planting system and two locations with a monoculture planting system. The results of measurements on cocoa plants show that carbon storage increased with the variety of plant species that exist in the cocoa farm. The size of the carbon stocks depends on the planting system. Cacao plantation with multistrata shades system showed carbon absorption of 148.92 tons/Ha that was greater than the amount of carbon absorption in cocoa plantation with monoculture shades system of 50.24 tons/Ha.

Carbon sequestration in arable soils, while tech-nically promising, faces the problems of heterogeneity in sequestration capacity, measurement, verification and permanence of sequestration. The variation of estimates on emissions reduction, abatement costs and differences in model simulations is large. A better basis for policy designs is needed. © 2020, The Scientific Agricultural Society of Finland.

Design: A duly designed database was developed, linking food nutritional composition and GHGE based on 921 food items consumed in Italy according to the last national food consumption survey (INRAN-SCAI 2005–2006). Linear programming was used to develop new diet plans separately for males and females, aged 18–60 years (n = 2,098 subjects), in order to minimize GHGE. The program is based on dietary goals and acceptability constraints as well as on 13 nutrient requirement constraints aiming to reach a healthy and acceptable diet for the Italian population. Results: Diet optimization resulted in a nutritionally adequate pattern minimizing GHGE values (4.0 vs. 1.9 kg CO2e/day for males and 3.2 vs. 1.6 kg CO2e/day for females). In both sexes, the nutrient intake of the optimized diet was at the established lower bound for cholesterol and calcium and at the established upper bound for free sugar and fiber. In males, intake of zinc was at the established lower bound whereas iron was at the established upper bound. Consumption of red meat and fruit and vegetables was at the established lower and upper bound, respectively, in both males and females. Despite the decrease in meat consumption, especially red meat, in the optimized diet with respect to the observed diet, levels of iron intake in females increased by 10% (10.3 vs. 11.3 mg/day) but remained below the adequate intake established in Italian national DRIs. Conclusions: An attainable healthy dietary pattern was developed that would lead to the reduction of GHGE by 48% for males and by 50% for females with respect to current food consumption in the Italian adult population. Health-promoting dietary patterns can substantially contribute to achieve related Sustainable Development Goals. © Copyright © 2020 Ferrari, Benvenuti, Rossi, De Santis, Sette, Martone, Piccinelli, Le Donne, Leclercq and Turrini.","diet optimization; dietary intakes; food consumption; greenhouse gas emissions; healthy and sustainable diet; linear programming; nutritional recommendations; sustainable development goals",,"Ferrari, M.; Research Centre for Food and Nutrition, Italy; email: marika.ferrari@crea.gov.it",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2296861X,,,,"English","Front.

The objective of this study was to investigate the C sequestration potential of conservation agriculture (CA) (defined by minimal soil disturbance, maintaining permanent soil cover, and crop rotations). This study used micrometeorological methods to measure carbon dioxide (CO2) flux from several alternative CA practices in Harare, central Zimbabwe. Micrometeorological methods can detect differences in total CO2 emissions of agricultural management practices; our results show that CA practices produce less CO2 emissions. Over three years of measurement, the mean and standard error (SE) of CO2 emissions for the plot with the most consistent CA practices was 0.564 ± 0.0122 g CO2 m−2 h−1, significantly less than 0.928 ± 0.00859 g CO2 m−2 h−1 for the conventional tillage practice.

Fifteen projects across five Canadian jurisdictions were reviewed. The examination revealed that well-developed intentions by EA authorities did not necessarily result in proponents following guidelines for GHG consideration in their EISs due to the absence of regulation or clearly defined policies. Conversely, even though intentions by an EA authority are underdeveloped in some jurisdictions, EISs sometimes exhibited thorough GHG assessments due to mechanisms in the EA process through which GHG consideration by the proponent could be compelled. The examination did not reveal how GHG consideration in EA currently assists in meeting reduction targets. A GHG emissions limit imposed during the EA process could link EA to success in meeting these targets. © 2019, © 2019 IAIA.","Canada; Climate change; EA; EIS; environmental impact assessment; GHG emissions; mitigation; reduction targets","climate change; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy implementation; Canada","Hetmanchuk, K.; Department of Geography, Canada; email: katja.hetmanchuk@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14615517,,,,"English","Impact Assess.

However, natural tropical freshwater wetlands are increasingly being converted into other land uses, mainly rice cultivation. In this study, we investigated the impact of conversion of a natural tropical freshwater wetland into a rice paddy wetland on SOC, by determining SOC content, density and storage potential in the natural section (under different vegetation communities dominated by Cyperus papyrus [Papyrus], Typha latifolia [Typha] and Phragmites mauritianus [Phragmites]) and in the converted section (under rice cultivation). The SOC contents (g kg−1) and densities (kg m−2) of the 3 vegetation communities (Papyrus; 123.7 ± 2.6 [SE] and 7.22 ± 0.11, Typha; 85.3 ± 1.1 and 6.71 ± 0.12, and Phragmites; 78.2 ± 3.4 and 6.20 ± 0.06, respectively) of the natural section of the wetland were significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) than those (39.7 ± 0.7 and 3.90 ± 0.06, respectively) of the converted section. Similarly, for the entire sampled soil depth (0–50 cm), SOC storage potentials (Mg ha−1) of Papyrus (361.18 ± 5.53), Typha (335.31 ± 6.18) and Phragmites (310.17 ± 3.16) significantly exceeded (p &lt; 0.05) that obtained in the converted section by nearly 46%, 42% and 38%, respectively. Soil physico-chemical characteristics: bulk density, salinity, pH and temperature, showed comparably significant correlations (p &lt; 0.05) with SOC in both the natural and converted sections of the wetland.

Little attention has been paid to attitudes of other important actors in the knowledge transfer chain. Evidence indeed suggests that adoption rarely happens at the farm level, but requires the right inputs from science and extension services. Divergent attitudes among actors in the knowledge transfer chain may hence contribute to low adoption rates by transferring insufficient, outdated, irrelevant and/or incorrect information. This study is an investigation on attitudes towards climate change mitigation and adaptation of three classes of actors: sheep farmers, researchers involved in fields related to sheep farming and extension officers from private companies and public agencies. The investigation is based on data collected through self-administered questionnaires submitted to 165 participants to agricultural field days in Sardinia (Italy). The sample consists of sheep farmers (37,5%), researchers (16,4%), extension officers (32,1%) and other agricultural workers or students (14 %). In order to assess differences in attitude and identify the sources of attitudinal divergence, the study adopts Kolmogorov – Smirnov (KS) equality-of-distribution tests and Partial-least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). Comparing and contrasting attitudes towards several topics related to GHG emission mitigation and adaptation to climate change reveal that researchers and extension officers have different attitudes towards innovation for mitigating GHG, that in turn depend on different information and beliefs on the causes and effects of climate change. This context is less than optimal to promote adoption of climate change mitigation or adaptation strategies. Climate change science and policy design need to recognise the complexity of knowledge transmission and the multiplicity of attitudes and beliefs that inform and affect the process. To mitigate the impact of diverging attitudes and beliefs among researchers and extension officers tailored communication strategies should avoid controversial issues and focus on benefits of innovation on farm efficiency. In turn, this would build trust and cooperation among all the actors in the knowledge transfer chain. Only when cooperation is assured, one could be confident that the information delivered to farmers is scientifically sound, relevant, value-neutral and useful in changing farmers' behaviour. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Attitudes; Climate change adaptation; Equality-of-distribution tests; GHG emission mitigation; Partial-least square structural equation modelling; Policy design; Technology transfer chain","adoption; adult; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; attitude; climate change; female; human; least square analysis; male; nonhuman; questionnaire; Sardinia; sheep farming; sound; structural equation modeling; technology; trust","Concu, G.B.; Universitá di Sassari and CRENoSItaly; email: gbconcu@uniss.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

On the one hand, rising temperatures from greenhouse gas accumulation cause impacts that fall more heavily on low-income countries. On the other hand, the costs of mitigating climate change through reduced emissions could slow down the economic catch-up of poor countries. Whether, and how much the recent decline in between-country inequalities will continue in the twenty-first century is uncertain, and the existing projections rarely account for climate factors. In this study, we build scenarios that account for the joint effects of mitigation costs and climate damages on inequality. We compute the evolution of country-by-country GDP, considering uncertainty in socioeconomic assumptions, emission pathways, mitigation costs, temperature response, and climate damages. We analyze the resulting 3408 scenarios using exploratory analysis tools. We show that the uncertainties associated with socioeconomic assumptions and damage estimates are the main drivers of future inequalities. We investigate under which conditions the cascading effects of these uncertainties can counterbalance the projected convergence of countries’ incomes. We also compare inequality levels across emission pathways and analyze when the effect of climate damages on inequality outweigh that of mitigation costs. We stress the divide between IAM- and econometrics-based damage functions in terms of their effect on inequality. If climate damages are as regressive as the latter suggest, climate mitigation policies are key to limit the rise of future inequalities between countries. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Climate change impact; Climate mitigation; Gini; Inequality; Scenario analysis; Socioeconomic scenario","Developing countries; Economic analysis; Greenhouse gases; Statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change impact; Climate mitigations; Gini; Inequality; Scenario analysis; Socioeconomic scenario; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; cost analysis; economic conditions; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; environmental factor; equity; Gross Domestic Product","Taconet, N.; Ecole des Ponts, 45 bis Avenue de la Belle Gabrielle, France; email: taconet@centre-cired.fr",,"Springer",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Land utilization with agroforestry patterns has been applied 25% of respondents, but the area of land used as agroforestry was still relatively small at 10% with the dominant types of plants are rubber, agarwood, and durian. The results showed that most people developed agroforestry patterns with two or more types because this pattern is more profitable regarding fulfilling the needs of short-term and longterm life. From an economic standpoint, the community developed rubber plants that are combined with other crops that have commercial value with the primary objective as an additional income especially with frequent fluctuations in the prices of the planted commodities.

A comparative analysis of the energy options for electricity generation in the nation was made considering availability, cost and greenhouse gases emission – CO2, N2O and CH4, using a two-stage method comprising multi-objective optimization and TOPSIS. The renewable (RE) and non-renewable energy (NRE) options available were assessed through the lifecycle approach to determine the lifecycle greenhouse gas emission (LCGHG) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE) per MWh of electricity. Considering historical electricity consumption, annual GDP and population growth from 1965, energy consumption for the year 2035 was forecasted using support vector machine regressor in Weka. Future plans in energy diversification pathways were examined through various scenario multi-objective optimizations with a constraint on resource availability and energy target using genetic algorithm in MATLAB. The outputs were ranked using TOPSIS method. Results showed that greenhouse gases emission could be reduced by 10.3 percent compared to business as usual scenario while the energy mix could attain 10 percent renewable energy in the grid at a relatively lower generation cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cost; Greenhouse gas; Lifecycle; Multi-objective optimization; Renewable energy; TOPSIS","diesel fuel; natural gas; petroleum; algorithm; alternative energy; atmospheric pollution; climate change; electricity generation; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; life cycle analysis; optimization; software; support vector machine; air pollution; Article; Brunei Darussalam; carbon footprint; climate change; cost; electricity; energy; environmental sustainability; genetic algorithm; greenhouse gas; hydropower; multiobjective optimization; non renewable energy; renewable energy; support vector machine; wind power; Southeast Asia; Gallirallus australis","Adedeji, A.R.; Faculty of Integrated Technologies, Jalan Tungku Link, Brunei Darussalam; email: rasaqdayo@gmail.com",,"Academic Press",03014797,,JEVMA,"32090795","English","J.

The Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goal 13 give fresh impetus for climate change mitigation action. However, mitigation policies can have unintended consequences for food security. The current study assessed the impacts of UK climate mitigation policies on future food penalties (using feed barley and meat) and to highlight potential tele-coupled implications for transnational food security (especially in developing economies). Total barley production for the 2030s, 2040s, and 2050s was obtained from simulated barley yields under three emissions scenarios (high, medium, and low; or HES, MES, and LES, respectively) and projected land area for barley production from the updated study on UK land use change under climate mitigation policies. Future demand for feed barley was obtained as a product of projected population and per capita demand. Feed barley equivalent meat production and demand were obtained using similar approach. The differences between future demand and supply were calculated for all combinations of climate change and land use scenarios. The results show that land area under climate mitigation scenarios would be 82–87% of the mean land area currently under barley production. Consequently, deficits in feed barley supply could range from 40 to 51% of total demand from the 2030s to the 2050s, while deficits in meat could be as high as 71% of total demand in the 2050s. As a result, the UK moves from its current position of net exporter of barley to a major net importer of barley or meat in the future. If current land area is maintained, maximum feed barley and meat deficits would be 44% and 65%, respectively, of total demand in the 2050s. For example, based on the middle of the road land use and climate change scenarios, together with projected 90th percentile yield, feed barley deficits in the UK would be 7102, 7548, and 7963 thousand tonnes for the 2030s, 2040s and 2050s, respectively. The main sources of export of barley to the UK would have either excess domestic demand over supply or inadequate surplus to meet the fractional exports required to serve the UK deficit. Potentially increased imports by the UK from Ukraine, Germany, and France would require an adjustment in the trade flows to the current top importers from these countries as the UK’s share of import would increase from less than 1% currently to 13%, 32%, and 183%, respectively. The observed magnitude of deficits highlights adverse impacts of UK land-based climate mitigation policies on its food security, with potential consequences for transnational food security, especially in developing economies that rely on the global market for feed barley or meat supply. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Barley; Climate change mitigation; Food security; Land use change; UK",,"Yawson, D.O.; Centre for Resource Management and Environmental Studies (CERMES), Cave Hill Campus, P.O.

Climate change favours conditions for plant pests in new areas as well as changing the way they are transmitted. Climate induced changes in pest activity affect agricultural production and food safety in several ways. Changes in climate variables may favour wider geographical distribution, prolonged overwintering, altered population growth rates, increased number of generations, extension of the development season, changes in crop-pest synchrony, inter-specific interactions and abundance of natural enemies, species extinction, increased risk of invasive pests and altered efficacy of crop protection technologies. Climate warming will also weaken crop health; reduce the host plant resistance, effectiveness of transgenic plants, natural enemies, efficacy of biopesticides and synthetic chemicals in pest management. Therefore, there is a need to generate information on the likely effects of climate change on crop pests to develop suitable technologies that will be effective in future to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on food security. This paper attempts to enlighten some of the documented views on the impact of climate warming in agriculture vis-à-vis their repercussions on the incidence of crop pests, specifically on the effects of raising temperatures, elevated CO2 levels, precipitation changes and the existing pest management practices in agro-ecosystems. © 2020 Plant Archives.

To avoid atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases that result in dangerous alterations of the climate, large reductions in carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel combustion and land use changes must be accompanied by an increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide sequestration.

A possible approach to this key issue in global economy is to take historical time series for nominal interest rates and inflation, and to construct then real interest rates and finally obtaining the resulting discount rate according to a specific stochastic model. Extended periods of negative real interest rates, in which inflation dominates over nominal rates, are commonly observed, occurring in many epochs and in all countries. This feature leads us to choose a well-known model in statistical physics, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, as a basic dynamical tool in which real interest rates randomly fluctuate and can become negative, even if they tend to revert to a positive mean value. By covering 14 countries over hundreds of years we suggest different scenarios and include an error analysis in order to consider the impact of statistical uncertainty in our results. We find that only 4 of the countries have positive long-run discount rates while the other ten countries have negative rates. Even if one rejects the countries where hyperinflation has occurred, our results support the need to consider low discounting rates. The results provided by these fourteen countries significantly increase the priority of confronting global actions such as climate change mitigation. We finally extend the analysis by first allowing for fluctuations of the mean level in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model and secondly by considering modified versions of the Feller and lognormal models. In both cases, results remain basically unchanged thus demonstrating the robustness of the results presented. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd and SISSA Medialab srl.","models of financial markets; quantitative finance; risk measure and management; Stochastic processes",,"Perelló, J.; Department of Condensed Matter Physics, Spain; email: josep.perello@ub.edu",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17425468,,,,"English","J.

Data were collected from 1538 rice farmers in the province of Hubei, China. We empirically examine the determinants of rice growers' intentions towards mitigation and adaption and their actual behaviors via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). Our results indicate that for TPB, behavioral intentions and perceived behavioral control account for 42.1% of farmers' adaptation behaviors, but only 25.6% for mitigation behaviors. In contrast, for the VBN theory, proenvironmental personal norms explain 54.2% of growers’ mitigation behaviors, but only 28.4% of adaptation behaviors. Thus, TPB appears to be more successful at predicting self-interest-oriented behaviors, such as climate change adaptation. On the other hand, our findings provide evidence that the VBN theory performs better when explaining altruistic behaviors like mitigation behaviors. These conclusions have important implications for the formulation of future policies that aim to promote effective and sustainable proenvironmental behavioral changes in agriculture, while ensuring global food security. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation behavior; Climate change; Mitigation behavior; Rice production; theory of planned behavior; Value-belief-norm theory",,"Luo, B.; National School of Agricultural Institution and Development, China; email: luobl@scau.edu.cn",,"Academic Press",02724944,,JEPSE,,"English","J.

To study the impact of the enrichment planting on carbon sequestration process, five exclosures with enrichment planting and five pure naturally regenerated exclosures were selected. Along parallel transects, 20 × 20 m plots were laid at 100 m intervals where all woody vegetations were counted and measured for their diameter and total height. For soil sampling, five subplots at the center and four at each corner of the plots were established. The samples were collected at a depth of 0–0.2 m, and this procedure was repeated for each plot. In this case, when good management practices were implemented (such as Wukro exclosures), significant differences in organic soil carbon above the ground and the total carbon between naturally regenerated and enriched exclosures (P < 0.05) were found. The mean estimates of the above ground carbon, soil carbon, and total carbon were respectively 8.08, 31.04, and 39.12 ton/ha for natural regeneration vs. 7.94, 31.00, and 38.93 ton/ha for enriched regeneration. Lower altitudes had significantly higher soil organic carbon (P < 0.05) than the higher altitudes. However, the slope had an insignificant effect on carbon distribution. Enriched exclosures performed more poorly in carbon sequestration. This was possibly due to the disturbances caused by mass plantation and poor post plantation follow up, since improved performance (P < 0.05) was seen in one enriched exclosure with better management practices. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon Sequestration; Enrichment; Environmental Management; Exclosure; Natural Regeneration; Slope","Blast enrichment; Climate change; Environmental management; Soils; Above-ground carbons; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Exclosure; Management practices; Natural regeneration; Slope; Soil organic carbon; Organic carbon; organic carbon; rain; carbon; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental management; organic carbon; organic soil; slope; soil organic matter; altitude; Article; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental enrichment; environmental management; Ethiopia; landscape; natural resource; plantation; planting time; sample; soil; total organic carbon; vegetation; carbon sequestration; soil; Ethiopia; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Ethiopia; Soil","Azadi, H.; Department of Geography, Belgium; email: hossein.azadi@ugent.be",,"Springer",0364152X,,EMNGD,"32055915","English","Environ.

As expected, threat and coping appraisal of climate change affect protection motivation. In addition, perceived moral obligation affects protection motivation. This protection motivation enhances the intention to participate in climate change mitigation behaviors.

A good understanding of energy systems from existing research will provide multidimensional insights for appropriate actions against global warming. This study conducts a systematic review of the literature covering 1,184 articles on energy issues dealing with climate change mitigation. Using a novel hand-coding typology analysis, we characterize the body of knowledge and identify possible research gaps according to the heterogeneity of the energy process, time scale, geographic location, energy technology, and concerned end-use sector. We find that research interest mainly focuses on the energy supply (496 papers) and the end-use process (359 papers). Energy storage and the energy–water–land nexus are two emerging areas. Biomass, solar, wind, and nuclear energy are the technologies that attract the most attention, while interest in hydrogen energy production and waste-to-energy has grown very recently. The cost-benefit and mitigation potential of renewable generation are the most studied topics, followed by the impacts of climate change on electricity production. In contrast, little attention is paid to research on traditional oil and gas exploration. Regarding the end-use sector, residents and transport are the most evident sectors studied. China, the United States, and Europe are the most featured regions while very few studies focus on Africa, South America, and Small Island Developing States. Current research topics concentrate on how to maximize the co-benefit of greenhouse gas mitigation and eco-environment protection via cost-benefit reinventions of energy systems. Discussions of technological innovation are grounded in optimal technology portfolio deployment and cost reduction potential, along with financial and political incentives. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy systems; Energy technology; Research frontiers; Systematic review","Climate change; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Electric energy storage; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Solar power generation; Climate change mitigation; Energy systems; Energy technologies; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Research frontiers; Small island developing state; Systematic Review; Technological innovation; Petroleum prospecting; alternative energy; climate change; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; innovation; literature review; nuclear power; research work; technological development; typology; Africa; China; Europe; South America; United States","Wei, Y.-M.; Center for Energy and Environmental Policy Research, China; email: wei@bit.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Using Jamaica, as an example, it is shown that the introduction of intermittent renewable energy to an island grid, which is electrically isolated, relying totally on itself for backup, causes serious frequency fluctuations and load shedding. Simulations show that a Battery Energy Storage System (BESS) using Li-ion batteries can be employed to economically overcome these problems. It is also noted that the cost of batteries with longer discharge capacity is on the decline and their use is expected to be become economical in about 10 years. Looking at the reported pathway to satisfy The Paris Agreement, a 2-phase pathway is suggested. In the Phase 1 (2020–2030) 30% integration of intermittent renewables with BESS backup can be implemented in a manner that is not economically burdensome whilst the remaining fossil fuel system can provide the firm energy needed. In Phase 2 (2030–2055), more renewables can be implemented, provided sufficient long term storage, including batteries, can be added to provide firm energy. By 2030 the cost of such storage is expected to fall resulting in increased deployment without a financial burden to the islands. Ideally, during the period 2020 to 2055, there should be no new additions of fossil fuel plants and retiring plants should be replaced by renewable energy plants; although an account is necessary for plants already in the planning and development stages. The leeway period of 2020–2030 should be used for the preparation and planning of adding up to 100% renewables in all sectors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery energy storage; Climate change; Energy security; Frequency fluctuations; Grid stability; Mitigation; Renewable energy; SIDS; Sustainability; The Paris agreement","Climate change; Costs; Electric load shedding; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Lithium-ion batteries; Sustainable development; Battery energy storage; Frequency fluctuation; Grid stability; Mitigation; Renewable energies; SIDS; Battery storage","Chen, A.A.; Department of Physics, Mona, Kingston 7, Jamaica; email: anthony.chen@uwimona.edu.jm",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077645112

Therefore, the present study focuses to supplement the existing information by estimating carbon stocks in temperate forests dominated by Cedrus deodara along the altitudinal gradients in the Central Himalaya. Three altitudes i.e., lower (1750 m), middle (1900 m) and upper (2050 m) of the stand was considered to understand and estimate biomass and soil carbon storage potential of the forests based on the standard protocol. The results showed that the soil carbon stock (SOC) decreased significantly with increasing soil depths and altitudes. Litterfall production in the forests varied adversely with altitude. Above and below-ground biomass carbon stock also decreased along with altitude. The study observed that the total carbon stock (soil, trees and forest floor) of the Cedrus deodara forest in different altitudes was 395.4 t ha−1 (lower altitude), 321.6 t ha−1 (middle altitude) and 282.5 t ha−1 (upper altitude). The estimates of the Cedrus forests would provide guidelines for estimating carbon for forest-based mitigation activities in the Himalayan region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Climate response; Forest litter; GHG removal; REDD+","Biomass; Climate change; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Soils; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Climate response; Forest litter; Litterfall production; REDD; Standard protocols; Forestry; biomass; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; deciduous forest; dominance; emission inventory; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; litter; mitigation; soil depth; soil organic matter; temperate forest; Himalayas; India; Cedrus; Cedrus deodara","Pandey, R.; Forest Research InstituteIndia; email: rajivfri@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

As a consequence, planning for climate change in urban areas does not only provide the opportunity but should necessitate considering interactions between mitigation and adaptation actions. However, existing research found that only a minority of urban areas consider both mitigation and adaptation in their climate action plans, i.e. 147 Climate Change Action Plans (CCAPs) were identified among a representative sample of 885 European cities. We investigate these 147 CCAPs to understand the degree of integration of adaptation and mitigation and draw implications for the maximization of synergies and co-benefits of such a combined approach. Using the developed scoring framework to evaluate the level of integration of CCAPs, the research finds that most of the plans reveal a ‘moderate’ level of integration. Moderate integration characterizes a plan that identifies sources of emissions and vulnerabilities to climate change, as well as some qualitative consideration of the synergies, but one that lacks a systematic consideration of potential integration opportunities. Furthermore, the analysis reveals that one of the main gaps of the evaluation and implementation of more integrated climate change actions in cities is the insufficient quantitative evaluation of the costs and funding schemes for adaptation and mitigation action implementation. © 2019","Co-benefits; European cities; Evaluation; Interrelationships; Planning; Scoring; Synergies; Urban","Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Planning; Urban planning; Co benefits; European cities; Evaluation; Interrelationships; Scoring; Synergies; Urban; Climate change","Grafakos, S.; Global Green Growth Institute, 21-15 Jeongdong-gil, Jung-gu, South Korea; email: stelios.grafakos@gggi.org",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077310572

Operational problems of solar power harnessing in cities such as high land costs and dust accumulation on the panels are obviated by installing solar panels on the otherwise rooftop area of the urban buses. Furthermore, the fuel consumption and hazardous emissions of buses decrease by improving their aerodynamic performance. An integrated solar power and aerodynamic model is developed, validated, and employed in a multi-objective optimization algorithm to compare proposed single-part (SiPS) and separate-part (SePS) systems. A multi-level stochastic procedure is applied to obtain a robust plan, calculate the economic payback, and study the feasibility of the optimal system's application using a novel combined economic-environmental ratio in Tabriz metropolitan city. The results showed that the costs of energy and vehicle-specific power were 0.922 $/kWh and 0.864 $/kWh, and −12.71 kW/t and −17.53 kW/t for the optimal SiPS and SePS, respectively. Moreover, 233.76 MWh/year green energy could be generated, 1132 tCO2-eq/year hazardous emissions could be reduced, and 398,400 US$ land costs could be saved by retrofitting the bus rapid transport routes in Tabriz with the SePS. Although the project was recommended if the energy unit price was greater than 0.25 $/kWh in the case study, it was profitable under almost all probable conditions considering the combined economic-environmental revenue. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerodynamic model; Climate change; Multi-objective optimization; Solar bus system; Tabriz metropolitan city; Techno-econo-environmental feasibility analysis","Aerodynamics; Buses; Climate change; Climate models; Economic analysis; Hazards; Multiobjective optimization; Phosphorus compounds; Retrofitting; Selenium compounds; Silicon compounds; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Stochastic systems; Transportation routes; Urban transportation; Aero-dynamic performance; Aerodynamic modeling; Bus systems; Climate change mitigation; Environmental feasibility; Metropolitan cities; Urban transportation systems; Vehicle specific power; Sulfur compounds","Yoo, C.; Dept. of Environmental Science and Engineering, Seocheon-dong 1, Giheung-gu, South Korea; email: ckyoo@khu.ac.kr",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The study proposes that analysis of data on the available amount of chemical and biological contamination in water is the first pressing requirement for this approach. In addition, climate change is causing an uneven pattern of rainfall and severe drought conditions and thus need a substantial attention to delineate the preventive ways for its mitigation in the water-scarce area as well as areas with high groundwater depletion or area contributing to the recharge. Most of the Indian rivers are polluted, and hence the removal of pollutants is an additional task for making a watershed resilient. There is a necessity to evaluate urban water for its better definition and develop the Water Quality Information Platform (WQIP) for layman understanding. The contemporary need for an approach for sustainable water supply must be developed with an understanding of the expected climate change scenario. The idea of “your experience, my learning opportunity” was found very relevant in implementing the developed world experience to a developing nation scenario. Study concludes that without a strong will power and action mantra of “Targeting the target: Bull's eye approach”, the resilience system will not be evolved. This study will have an impact on the critical scientific knowledge of deterioration of water quality, posing a threat to potable water availability, and also on the development of sustainable water management. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Perception; Policy; Urbanization; Water resilience","Chemical analysis; Deterioration; Developing countries; Potable water; Public policy; Quality control; Recharging (underground waters); River pollution; Sensory perception; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Water supply; Chemical and biologicals; Climate change scenarios; Groundwater depletion; Sustainable water management; Sustainable water supply; Urbanization; Vulnerability mitigation; Water quality information; Climate change; climate change; developing world; drought; rainfall; urban area; urbanization; vulnerability; water management; water quality; water supply; India","Kumar, M.; Discipline of Earth Sciences, India; email: manish.kumar@iitgn.ac.in",,"Elsevier B.V.",2352801X,,,,"English","Groundw.

While households as agents of change increasingly become a crucial element in energy transitions, bottom-up mechanisms facilitating behavioral change are not fully understood. A scientific understanding of individual energy use, requires eliciting factors that trigger or inhibit changes in energy behavior. This paper explores individual energy consumption practices and behavioral aspects that affect them. We quantitatively study the determinants of three energy actions: (1) investments in house insulation, solar panels and/or energy-efficient appliances, (2) conservation of energy by changing energy-use habits like switching off unused devices or adjusting house temperature, and (3) switching to green(er) electricity sources. To address this goal, we conduct a comprehensive survey among households (N = 1790) in two EU regions: Overijssel, the Netherlands and Navarre, Spain. We use probit regression to estimate how behavioral factors, households’ socioeconomic characteristics and structural attributes of dwellings influence energy related actions. Our analysis demonstrates that awareness and personal and social norms are as important as monetary factors. Moreover, education and structural dwelling factors significantly affect households’ actions. These results have implications for governmental policies aimed at reducing residential CO2 footprints and facilitating demand-side solutions in a transition to low-carbon economy. © 2019 The Authors","Awareness; Energy-efficiency; Low-carbon economy; Personal norms; Policy implication; Probit regression; Residential energy demand; Survey",,"Niamir, L.; Department of Governance and Technology for Sustainability, Netherlands; email: niamir@mcc-berlin.net",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

Agriculture sector also contributes to the causes of climate change through the emission of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). Hence, adaptation-led mitigation measures are required to sustain agricultural productivity, farm income and reduce GHG emissions wherever possible. This study presents a systematic review of agriculture emission reduction opportunities with a particular focus on agricultural production systems in South Asia. Our review indicates that the adoption of better soil, water, nutrient management practices, and technologies has enormous potential to reduce GHG emissions from agriculture, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. Many existing practices and technologies have the potential to improve both adaptation and mitigation in agriculture which can significantly contribute to complying with nationally determined contributions (NDCs) of South Asian countries. However, barriers to the adoption of GHG mitigating agricultural practices, mainly the financial and institutional barriers, need to be appropriately addressed to achieve the desired level of mitigation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climate change; Greenhouse gas mitigation; South Asia","agricultural production; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; rainfall; South Asia","Rahut, D.B.; International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT), Carretera México-Veracruz Km. 45 El Batán, Mexico; email: dilbhutan@gmail.com",,"Springer",1387585X,,EDSNB,,"English","Environ.

However, the implementation of nature-based solutions stems from a discourse that is almost exclusively derived from a terrestrial and urban context and assumes that risk reduction is resolved locally. We argue that this position ignores the importance of complex ecological interactions across a range of temporal and spatial scales and misses the substantive contribution from marine ecosystems, which are notably absent frommost climatemitigation and adaptation strategies that extend beyond coastal disaster management. Here, we consider the potential of sediment-dwelling fauna and flora to inform and support nature-based solutions, and howthe ecology of benthic environments can enhance adaptation plans. We illustrate our thesis with examples of practice that are generating, or have the potential to deliver, transformative change and discuss where further innovation might be applied. Finally, we take a reflective look at the realized and potential capacity of benthic-based solutions to contribute to adaptation plans and offer our perspectives on the suitability and shortcomings of past achievements and the prospective rewards from sensible prioritization of future research. © 2019 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.","Habitat restoration; Marine protection; Natural capital; Nature-based solutions; Offshore development; Rewilding","benthic environment; climate change; disaster management; ecosystem resilience; environmental planning; habitat restoration; marine environment; natural capital; offshore application; prioritization; acclimatization; climate change; ecosystem; environment; environmental protection; Acclimatization; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environment","Solan, M.; School of Ocean and Earth Science, European Way, United Kingdom; email: m.solan@soton.ac.uk",,"Royal Society Publishing",09628436,,PTRBA,"31983332","English","Philos.

Both efforts have failed to achieve the scale of action needed to halt biodiversity loss or mitigate climate change.We argue that success can be achieved by aligning targets for biodiversity protection with the habitat protection and restoration necessary to bring down greenhouse gas concentrations and promote natural and societal adaptation to climate change. Success, however, will need much higher targets for environmental protection than the present 10% of sea and 17% of land. A new target of 30% of the sea given high levels of protection from exploitation and harm by 2030 is under consideration and similar targets are being discussed for terrestrial habitats.

Policy network analysis is a way to explore connections between adaptation and mitigation, and the opportunities or barriers to effective integration between these two policy subdomains. This study explores climate governance and policy networks by examining collaboration and information flows in national policy processes in Peru, a country with an active climate change policy domain. In contrast to most climate policy network analyses, this study distinguishes adaptation and mitigation subdomains through a multiplex approach. We used ERGM (Exponential Random Graph Models) to explain the existence of information flows and collaborations among 76 key actors in climate change policy in Peru. We identified actors who could connect adaptation and mitigation subdomains. Results show a concentration of influence in national government actors, particularly in the mitigation subdomain, and the isolation of actor groups that matter for policy implementation, such as the private sector or subnational actors. Results highlight the predominance of mitigation over adaptation and the existence of actors well positioned to broker relationships between the subdomains. The top brokers across subdomains were, however, not only actors with high centrality and brokerage roles in the subdomains, but also several ‘unusual key players’ that were not brokers in any of the two layers separately. Key policy insights National government institutions are central actors in climate change policy networks in Peru, reflecting national ownership of the climate change issue. Private sector organizations and subnational actors in Peru are the least involved in information sharing and collaboration on climate change. Actors from different levels and sectors are active in both adaptation and mitigation, which is good for climate policy integration. Actors with the capacity to bridge the two policy subdomains are not necessarily central to each subdomain but may be actors that close structural holes between subdomains. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Broker; ERGM; multiplex; network analysis; policy coherence; synergy","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; network analysis; policy implementation; Peru","Locatelli, B.; Cirad, France; email: bruno.locatelli@cirad.fr",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

However, the sector itself is vulnerable to the impacts of global warming. Extreme weather events and gradual changes in climate variables can affect the reliability, cost, and environmental impacts of the energy supply. This paper analyzed the interplay between CO2 mitigation attempts and adaptations to climate change in the power sector using the Long-range Energy Alternative Planning System (LEAP) model. This paper presented a novel methodology to integrate both CO2 mitigation goals and the impacts of climate change into simulations of a power system expansion. The impacts on electricity supply and demand were quantified, based on historical climate-related impacts revealed during fieldwork and existing literature. The quantified effects, together with climate mitigation targets, were then integrated into the LEAP modeling architecture. The results showed a substantial alteration in technology composition and an increase in installed capacities driven by the joint climate mitigation–adaptation efforts when compared with the scenario without mitigation and adaptation (reference). Furthermore, an increase in CO2 emissions was observed under the mitigation-adaptation scenario compared with the mitigation only scenario, indicating that the power sector's adaptations for climate change are likely to hinder CO2 mitigation efforts. Therefore, a nexus between mitigation and adaptation should be exploited in the policy development for a low-carbon and climate-resilient power system. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Energy sector; LEAP; Paris Agreement; Power sector","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Energy policy; Environmental impact; Global warming; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Energy sector; LEAP; Power sector; Climate models; adaptive management; carbon emission; climate change; electricity generation; electricity supply; global warming; methodology","Handayani, K.Room RA 1161, Ravelijn Building, P.O.

Scenarios indicate that climate change mitigation will increase global wood demand. This might call for adjustments of well-established management approaches. This study investigates to what extent increasing wood demands in three climate change mitigation scenarios can be satisfied with current forest management approaches of different intensities in a southern Swedish region. Forest management practices in Kronoberg County were mapped through interviews, statistics, and desk research and were translated into five different management strategies with different intensities regulating management at the property level. The consequences of current practices, as well as their intensification, were analyzed with the Heureka Planwise forest planning system in combination with a specially developed forest owner decision simulator. Projections were done over a 100-year period under three climate change mitigation scenarios developed with the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIUM). Current management practices could meet scenario demands during the first 20 years. This was followed by a shortage of wood during two periods in all scenarios unless rotations were reduced. In a longer timeframe, the wood demands were projected to be easily satisfied in the less ambitious climate change mitigation scenarios. In contrast, the demand in the ambitious mitigation scenario could not be met with current management practices, not even if all owners managed their production forests at the intensive extreme of current management approaches. The climate change mitigation scenarios provide very different trajectories with respect to future drivers of forest management. Our results indicate that with less ambitious mitigation efforts, the relatively intensive practices in the study region can be softened while ambitious mitigation might push for further intensification. © 2020 by the authors.

Aboveground carbon stock was 68.15 million tons accounting for 48% of the total forest carbon stock of the province. Further, belowground biomass and litter accounted for 10% and 1% respectively. The mean aboveground carbon stock was 59.98 ± 4.26 t/ha. The highest aboveground carbon stock was found in dry temperate forests (99.41 t/ha) followed by moist temperate (85.04 t/ha). Overall, temperate forests have aboveground carbon stock of 90.52 t/ha. Temperate and subtropical forests of Pakistan with high carbon densities have ample potential for reducing forest sector emissions. Therefore, forests of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province having substantial carbon stocks must be conserved for climate change mitigation. Present study provides a framework for carbon stock assessments in other temperate and subtropical regions of the world. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biomass; Carbon pool; Forest; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Temperate","Biomass; Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Tropics; Above-ground carbons; Belowground biomass; Carbon pool; Climate change mitigation; Forest; Khyber Pakhtunkhwa; Subtropical forests; Temperate; Forestry; carbon; biomass; carbon emission; climate change; estimation method; forest; subtropical region; temperate forest; Abies pindrow; Article; biogeographic region; biomass; carbon footprint; Cedrus deodara; climate change; cluster analysis; controlled study; environmental protection; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Hazara; information processing; nonhuman; Pakistan; Picea smithiana; Pinus gerardiana; Pinus roxburghii; Pinus wallichiana; plant litter; Quercus ilex; species; stock assessment; temperate deciduous forest; tree; environmental monitoring; forest; Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa; Pakistan; Biomass; Carbon; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Pakistan; Trees","Ashraf, M.I.; Department of Forestry & Range Management, Pakistan; email: irfanashraf@uaar.edu.pk",,"Springer",01676369,,EMASD,"32107638","English","Environ.

Versuchsanstalt, Göttingen, Germany","We compare sustainably managed with unmanaged forests in terms of their contribution to climate change mitigation based on published data. For sustainably managed forests, accounting of carbon (C) storage based on ecosystem biomass and products as required by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is not sufficient to quantify their contribution to climate change mitigation. The ultimate value of biomass is its use for biomaterials and bioenergy. Taking Germany as an example, we show that the average removals of wood from managed forests are higher than stated by official reports, ranging between 56 and 86 mill. m3 year−1 due to the unrecorded harvest of firewood. We find that removals from one hectare can substitute 0.87 m3 ha−1 year−1 of diesel, or 7.4 MWh ha−1 year−1, taking into account the unrecorded firewood, the use of fuel for harvesting and processing, and the efficiency of energy conversion. Energy substitution ranges between 1.9 and 2.2 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 year−1 depending on the type of fossil fuel production. Including bioenergy and carbon storage, the total mitigation effect of managed forest ranges between 3.2 and 3.5 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 year−1. This is more than previously reported because of the full accounting of bioenergy. Unmanaged nature conservation forests contribute via C storage only about 0.37 t CO2 equiv. ha−1 year−1 to climate change mitigation. There is no fossil fuel substitution. Therefore, taking forests out of management reduces climate change mitigation benefits substantially. There should be a mitigation cost for taking forest out of management in Central Europe. Since the energy sector is rewarded for the climate benefits of bioenergy, and not the forest sector, we propose that a CO2 tax is used to award the contribution of forest management to fossil fuel substitution and climate change mitigation. This would stimulate the production of wood for products and energy substitution. © 2020 The Authors.

We assess the potential for 40 practices to address these land challenges and find that: Nine options deliver medium to large benefits for all four land challenges. A further two options have no global estimates for adaptation, but have medium to large benefits for all other land challenges. Five options have large mitigation potential (&gt;3 Gt CO2eq/year) without adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Five options have moderate mitigation potential, with no adverse impacts on the other land challenges. Sixteen practices have large adaptation potential (&gt;25 million people benefit), without adverse side effects on other land challenges. Most practices can be applied without competing for available land. However, seven options could result in competition for land. A large number of practices do not require dedicated land, including several land management options, all value chain options, and all risk management options. Four options could greatly increase competition for land if applied at a large scale, though the impact is scale and context specific, highlighting the need for safeguards to ensure that expansion of land for mitigation does not impact natural systems and food security. A number of practices, such as increased food productivity, dietary change and reduced food loss and waste, can reduce demand for land conversion, thereby potentially freeing-up land and creating opportunities for enhanced implementation of other practices, making them important components of portfolios of practices to address the combined land challenges. © 2019 The Authors.

This study takes several new angles in investigating farmers’ climate change mitigation behaviour. Based on two identical surveys among representative samples of Dutch farmers, this study examines the underlying determinants and motivating factors for three different types of climate change mitigation measures on farms: energy saving, the production of renewable energy and reduction of emissions of methane and nitrous oxide (non-CO2 emissions). Furthermore, the study explores whether farmers’ awareness and behaviour has been influenced by a communication campaign carried out by the government of the Netherlands between 2012 and 2015. Four major conclusions emerge. Firstly, the analyses demonstrate that accounting for the cost-effectiveness and technology readiness level (TRL) of different types of climate change mitigation measures provides for a better understanding of the factors that motivate farmers to adopt these measures. Secondly, neither the willingness to take GHG reduction measures nor knowledge on GHG emissions are consistent motivating factors for energy-related measures. Thirdly, it seems that external factors, such as economic hardship, dominate the overall environmental awareness of farmers. Fourthly, the farmer’s propensity to innovate proved to be the strongest and most consistent predictor of both the willingness and the actual adoption of climate change mitigation technologies. Therefore, focusing on making farmers more open to change and general innovation in campaigns in the agricultural sector might be more effective than campaigns focusing specifically on climate change mitigation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Climate change mitigation; Communication campaign; Energy use; Farmer behaviour","Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Motivation; Nitrogen oxides; Agricultural sector; Climate change mitigation; Energy use; Environmental awareness; Farmer behaviour; Reduction of emissions; Representative sample; Technology readiness levels; Climate change; agricultural production; alternative energy; climate change; communication network; energy use; farmers attitude; greenhouse gas; innovation; knowledge; methane; nitrous oxide; Netherlands","Moerkerken, A.; Netherlands Enterprise Agency RVO, Croeselaan 15, Netherlands; email: albert.moerkerken@rvo.nl",,"Springer",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

We apply this framework to evaluate two agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation research science projects funded in New Zealand: research looking at mitigation options given by genetic markers for low methane animals, and the identification of emission-reducing management practices. From this analysis we achieve two main findings. First, the prominence of the research combined with the low likelihood of research occurring on this scale without public support suggests strongly that the results would not have been obtained in absence of public funding. Second, the advances reached in some areas have the potential for GHG emission reductions that would be significant in environmental terms, and whose value at likely carbon pricing levels would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. The results discussed are conditional on several factors such as future domestic and international policy settings and implementation, adoption rates and the practical availability of mitigation options and practices for different farm landscapes. However, the impacts and economic and environmental values attached to these research projects, and mitigation research more generally, cannot be overlooked.

The results show that upstream activities are the main contributors to emission (68%), with only 32% allocated to the reporting organisation.

This study was conducted to estimate the carbon stock and its contribution to climate change disaster reduction in Zeghie peninsula, Ethiopia. Sample plots were laid along line transects based on altitudinal and slope variation of the study area. A total of 45 plots (40 m × 40 m each) were selected using random sampling techniques. The data obtained from each sample were analyzed by using allometric equations. The results revealed that the mean total carbon stock was 381.41 t/ha, of which 191.58 t/ha, 45.98 t/ha, 0.03 t/ha, 139.04 t/ha and 4.77 t/ha, which were observed in the aboveground carbon, belowground carbon, litter carbon, soil organic carbon in (30 cm depth) and deadwood carbon, respectively. The mean total CO2 equivalent of the study area was also 1399.78 t/ha. In relation to altitudinal gradients and slopes, the result showed that the stock of carbon was variable along the altitudinal variation with a mean value of 420.71t/ha, 458.78t/ha and 516.77t/ha in upper, middle and lower elevations, respectively. While a mean value of carbon along the slope gradient was 401.82t/ha, 439.26t/ha and 516.9t/ha in upper, medium and lower slope classes, respectively. Generally, the carbon stocks in aboveground, belowground, litter and soil organic carbon were exhibited less distinct patterns along altitudinal gradients. The aboveground, belowground, litter and soil organic carbon stocks showed decreasing trend with increasing altitude and slope while dead wood carbon stock showed increasing trend along altitudinal gradients. The total CO2 stored in Zeghie peninsula forestland was approximately 62,990.4 tons annually, but emission was estimated to be 8274.97 tons.

In recent studies afforestation is presented as a major solution to limit climate change. However, estimates of afforestation potential vary widely. Moreover, the risks in global mitigation policy and the negative trade-offs with food security are often not considered. Here we present a new approach to assess the economic potential of afforestation with the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework. In addition, we discuss the role of afforestation in mitigation pathways and the effects of afforestation on the food system under increasingly ambitious climate targets. We show that afforestation has a mitigation potential of 4.9 GtCO2/year at 200 US$/tCO2 in 2050 leading to large-scale application in an SSP2 scenario aiming for 2°C (410 GtCO2 cumulative up to 2100). Afforestation reduces the overall costs of mitigation policy. However, it may lead to lower mitigation ambition and lock-in situations in other sectors. Moreover, it bears risks to implementation and permanence as the negative emissions are increasingly located in regions with high investment risks and weak governance, for example in Sub-Saharan Africa. Afforestation also requires large amounts of land (up to 1,100 Mha) leading to large reductions in agricultural land. The increased competition for land could lead to higher food prices and an increased population at risk of hunger. Our results confirm that afforestation has substantial potential for mitigation. At the same time, we highlight that major risks and trade-offs are involved. Pathways aiming to limit climate change to 2°C or even 1.5°C need to minimize these risks and trade-offs in order to achieve mitigation sustainably. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","afforestation; climate change mitigation; food security; integrated assessment; land-based mitigation; negative emissions","afforestation; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; food security; land management; risk assessment; trade-off; Africa south of the Sahara; agriculture; catering service; climate change; Africa South of the Sahara; Agriculture; Climate Change; Food Supply","Doelman, J.C.; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment AgencyNetherlands; email: jonathan.doelman@pbl.nl",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13541013,,,"31655005","English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073747395

In recent years, a large number of authors have analysed the determinants of behaviour related to climate change. However, in this paper, referring to the behaviour and consumption level, we focused on energy consumption and direct household CO2 emissions. Thus, the objective of this study was to evaluate the determinants of energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the Lithuanian residential sector. Energy consumption was evaluated referring to the residential bills based on the official energy prices; CO2 emission equivalent was calculated employing the emission factors for separate energy resources. The regression analysis revealed that attitudes were significant only in the case of energy consumption for heating, but not in the case of heating-related CO2, which depended solely on the housing area, the type of fuel, and home heating (centralized). Meanwhile, concerning electricity consumption and related CO2 emissions, the pro-environmental behaviour was one of the factors along with the type of house, the number of children, family size, and gender. Results indicated that a complex of different factors needed to be considered to increase energy savings and CO2 reduction inthe residential sector regarding heating and electricity consumption. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Environmental knowledge; Pro-environmental behaviour","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric power utilization; Energy conservation; Heating; Housing; Regression analysis; Attitude; Climate change mitigation; CO2 emissions; Consumption levels; Electricity-consumption; Environmental knowledge; Pro-environmental behaviour; Residential sectors; Energy utilization; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; energy storage; energy use; regression analysis","Liobikienė, G.; Department of Environmental Sciences, Vileikos st. 8, Lithuania; email: genute77@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076713251

Accordingly, a large amount of energy, particularly fossil fuels, should be supplied annually to this important sector of the industry, thereby increasing environmental hazards for human health and ecosystems. Therefore, the hotspots of energy consumption and environmental impacts of food production systems should be accurately identified in order to improve their efficiency and sustainability. To this end, energy consumption and environmental impacts of apple juice production in West Azarbaijan province of Iran was analyzed in the present study from farm gate to end of packaging of bottled juice using energy flow and life cycle assessment (LCA) approaches. According to the results of energy analysis, the specific energy consumption of apple juice production was found to be 28.33 MJ/bottle. More specifically, diesel fuel, natural gas, and polyethylene terephthalate bottles had the greatest contributions to the specific energy consumption of apple juice production. Based on the outcomes of the LCA approach, the corresponding life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions of the resources consumed in apple juice production were 1.83 kg CO2 eq, mainly caused by the combustion of diesel and natural gas. The damages to ecosystem quality due to acidification and eutrophication were respectively found to be 1.69 × 10−2 kg SO2 eq and 4.54 × 10−3 kg PO4 −3 eq, mainly because of resources utilization in the agricultural production step. The emissions released due to the consumption of chemical fertilizers and farmyard manure in the agricultural production step had the highest impacts in acidification and eutrophication impact categories. The emissions arisen from the production and consumption of pesticides were the hotspots in abiotic depletion, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, and terrestrial ecotoxicity. Overall, it could be concluded that using bio-fertilizers and biological control approaches in the agricultural production step as well as implementing renewable energy technologies in the juicing step could potentially mitigate the environmental burdens of apple juice production. © 2019","Apple juice; Apple production; Energy consumption; Environmental analysis; Juice processing; Life cycle assessment","Acidification; Climate change; Diesel engines; Ecosystems; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Eutrophication; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Fruit juices; Fruits; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Health hazards; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Ozone layer; Plastic bottles; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Apple juice; Apple production; Environmental analysis; Juice processing; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle","Khanali, M.; Department of Agricultural Machinery Engineering, Iran; email: khanali@ut.ac.ir",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

We address this question by assessing the financial impacts and macroeconomic implications of carbon pricing and public subsidies. More specifically, we evaluate the extent to which such policies are sustainable by computing the probability of remaining below two thresholds that we argue to be indicative of the stability of our current economy and climate: (1) a temperature anomaly above +2°C (a commonly acknowledged target, including in the 2015 Paris Agreement, to potentially avoid nonlinearities in the climate system) and (2) a large global debt-to-output ratio of 270%. Key policy insights The upper-bound of the carbon pricing corridor advocated in the High-Level Commission on Carbon Prices (2017. Report of the high-level commission on carbon prices. Washington, DC: World Bank), when implemented together with additional public subsidies on abatement costs in the private sector, is likely to successfully ensure sustainable economic growth by the end of the century. The probability that these climate policies will allow us to cap the average Earth temperature deviation at below +2.5°C by the end of this century is about 50%. Without a strong public commitment, the impact of climate change on gross output and capital, which captures nonlinear effects such as tipping points, appears to be powerful enough to pull the world economy towards a debt-deflationary field, potentially leading to forced degrowth in the second half of the twenty-first century. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon pricing; credit rationing; Ecological macroeconomics; integrated assessment; stock-flow consistency","climate change; emissions trading; environmental economics; financial crisis; integrated approach; macroeconomics; pollution tax","McIsaac, F.; Chair Energy & Prosperity, 28 place de la Bourse, France; email: mcisaacf@afd.fr",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

The main sources of agricultural GHGEs are fuel use, land use change, soil cultivation, and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions, whereas animal waste and enteric fermentation are the most important GHGEs from animal husbandry. Carbon footprint (CF; CO2-equivalent kg?1 of product) determination through life cycle analysis (LCA) enables the quantification of the contribution of different methods of production to GHGEs. It allows for a comparison of CF among different products, as well as production optimization that typically results in production costs reduction. Research results highlight that the CF of agricultural products can be reduced through lowering inputs (e.g., fertilizers, fuel) for production, using varieties well adapted to the local environment, increasing carbon storage in soil, and minimizing transportation distance to the markets. Changing from intensive (high-input) to low-input agriculture reduces emissions. However, research should be conducted to explore if low-input agriculture maintains productivity at the required levels to feed an increasing global population. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

It is commonly accepted that anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions are the main cause that is accelerating the process. Therefore, it is urgent to find solutions to mitigate climate change, mainly because the intense effects have already been felt, in many cases in the form of the occurrence of extremely violent weather events. Forests are undoubtedly one of the most effective and easiest ways to provide the function of carbon sinks. However, it is essential and convenient to analyze the permanence time of this carbon in forests, because this permanence time depends directly on the forest management model used. This article aims to analyze forest management models from the perspective of carbon residence time in temperate forests, dividing the models into three types, namely carbon conservation models, carbon storage models, and carbon substitution models, according to their ability to contribute to functioning as carbon sinks, thereby contributing to the mitigation of climate change. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon cycle; Carbon sinks; Climate change; Forest management",,"Nunes, L.J.R.; ICAAM-Instituto de Ciências Agrárias e Ambientais Mediterrânicas, Portugal; email: d39529@alunos.uevora.pt",,"MDPI AG",22251154,,,,"English","Clim.",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080935766

Copper mining can serve as a case study to analyse the measurable pathways by which mining contributes to climate change through direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. For example, mining, processing and transportation require fuel and electricity, and the decomposition of carbonate minerals, employed to reduce environmental impacts, also releases carbon dioxide. Overall, we estimate that greenhouse gas emissions associated with primary mineral and metal production was equivalent to approximately 10% of the total global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. For copper mining, fuel consumption increased by 130% and electricity consumption increased by 32% per unit of mined copper in Chile from 2001 to 2017, largely due to decreasing ore grade. This trend of increasing energy demand to produce the same quantity of some metals compounds the problems of increased metal demand due to the pressures of new technologies and increasing population. For green technologies to be implemented effectively, it is necessary that the mining industry and regulators accurately and transparently account for greenhouse gas emissions to implement mitigation strategies. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",,"climate change; climate effect; emission; environmental impact; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; mining; mining industry; mitigation; policy implementation; Chile","Ali, S.H.; Sustainable Minerals Institute, Australia; email: saleem@udel.edu",,"Nature Research",17520894,,,,"English","Nat.

These technologies are considered to be potential substitutes for mitigation strategies in combating climate change. The ongoing process of layperson acceptance and resultant opinion formation can be expected to play a crucial role in future public debate about field experiments or the actual deployment of climate engineering. In July 2017, we assessed public reactions from the German population in a representative online survey. Participants were given a brief text informing them about climate change and one of four different scenarios in a between-subject design (N = 678). Two of the scenarios described the use of climate engineering technologies - stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) and bio-energy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) - one of them covered conventional mitigation strategies and the fourth group was given an outline of the business-as-usual (BAU) approach. The mitigation scenario (willingness for individual behaviour changes) showed the highest acceptance rate (M = 74.23), which was significantly higher than acceptance of the other scenarios (p < .001). Acceptance of BECCS (M = 53.15) was higher than acceptance of SAI (M = 46.25, p = .043) and BAU (M = 42.94; p = .006). We undertook a relative-importance analysis to investigate the influence of multiple predictor variables on acceptance formation for each scenario; the variance thus explained ranged from 80.3% to 86.8%.

This is of interest because the environmental significance of federal political systems is still contested. We first review the literature on federalism in the context of environmental and climate policymaking, and we show that the effects of federal political systems can be positive or negative (depending on interactions between politics and problem characteristics). We then summarize the two qualitative country studies. By analysing who initiated and coordinated respective policies at what time and why, we show that respective policy changes neither emerged bottom-up nor diffused between provinces/cantons, although the latter are fully responsible for building policies. While most policy changes were triggered by federal and/or European Union interventions, the provinces/cantons usually delayed and/or watered down policy changes to smallest common denominator solutions. Based on these findings we conclude that the building sectors of the two countries became more efficient despite, not because of federalism. Against this background we recommend centralizing building policies, or to engage sub-national actors in national target-setting early on. © 2019 The Authors.

Data were collected using household surveys and standard biomass assessment approaches using locally relevant allometric equations. Summary statistics and regression analyses reveal linkages between on-farm carbon stocks and farm- and household characteristics. With an average of 4.07 ± 0.68 Mg C ha−1 and Shannon diversity index of 3.06, farm carbon stocks were significantly associated with farm size (r = 0.453, p &lt; 0.05), tree density (r = − 0.58, p = 0.05) and the average size of trees on farm (r = − 0.42, p = 0.05), but not by Shannon diversity index (r = 0.36, p = 0.080), species richness (r = − 0.044, p = 0.833) or the number of land use categories (r = − 0.192, p = 0.356). Timber was considered the most important use of on-farm trees before firewood and construction material. The results suggest that gaining self-sufficiency in firewood is the most important benefit with on-farm carbon accumulation. The focus on exotic species for timber production presents a considerable trade-off between livelihood options and environmental goals. Heterogeneity in local environmental conditions over very short distances, less than 12 km, significantly determine livelihood strategies and on-farm carbon stocks. These results ostensibly contradict that carbon storage in smallholder farms is determined by diversity of tree species, suggest that livelihood strategy can equally drive carbon storage and demonstrate the diversity of livelihood and environmental benefits derived from trees on farms. © 2019, The Author(s).","Aboveground biomass; Carbon stocks; On-farm trees; Species diversity; Trade-off","agroforestry; biomass; carbon storage; climate change; diversity index; environmental conditions; farm size; forestry production; land use; livelihood; self sufficiency; smallholder; species richness; Kenya","Kuyah, S.; Department of Botany, P.O.

While a growing academic literature analyzes this problem, perceptions of which obstacles inhibit goal attainment and which responses might be most effective seem to differ widely. This makes prioritization and agreement on the way forward difficult. To inform prioritization in global climate policy and research agendas, we present quantitative data on how 917 experts from the IPCC and the UNFCCC perceive the importance of different obstacles and response options for achieving 2 °C. On average, respondents consider opposition from special interest groups the most important obstacle and technological R&D the most important response. Our survey also finds that the majority of experts perceives a wide range of issues as important, supporting an agenda that is inclusive in terms of coverage. Average importance ratings differ between experts from the Global North and South, suggesting that balanced representation in global fora and regionally differentiated agendas are important. In particular, opposition from special interest groups is a top priority among experts from North America, Europe and Oceania. Investigating the drivers of individual importance ratings, we find little difference between experts from the IPCC and the UNFCCC, while expert's perceptions correlate with their academic training and their national scientific, regulatory, and financial contexts. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this line, the European Union is focusing on a strict 2030 energy agenda in order to achieve a climate-neutral Europe by 2050, in line with all necessary reductions by developed countries as a group and at the same time make a fair and ambitious contribution to the Paris Agreement. Since, 70% of cities are already dealing with the effects of climate change, along with their rapid growth and the high intensity of urban sprawl, Local Authorities' role is of vital importance. Moreover, besides environmental and social related factors that drive the battle against climate change, economic parameters represent key drivers of CO2 emissions' reduction policies. In this framework, the most important initiative on a European Level, is the Covenant of Mayors - CoM that was created in 2008 and gathers more than 9.660 signatories globally that have voluntarily committed to create Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans (SECAPs). In this line, the EMPOWERING Project, launched in 2017, aimed at supporting Local Authorities enhance their capacity in terms of planning efficient energy measures within the new European 2030 framework for Climate and Energy Policy.

To meet climate-change mitigation needs, one must go beyond operational energy consumption and related GHG emissions of buildings and address their full life cycle. This study investigates the global trends of GHG emissions arising across the life cycle of buildings by systematically compiling and analysing more than 650 life cycle assessment (LCA) case studies. The results, presented for different energy performance classes based on a final sample of 238 cases, show a clear reduction trend in life cycle GHG emissions due to improved operational energy performance. However, the analysis reveals an increase in relative and absolute contributions of so‐called ‘embodied’ GHG emissions, i.e., emissions arising from manufacturing and processing of building materials. While the average share of embodied GHG emissions from buildings following current energy performance regulations is approximately 20–25% of life cycle GHG emissions, this figure escalates to 45–50% for highly energy-efficient buildings and surpasses 90% in extreme cases. Furthermore, this study analyses GHG emissions at time of occurrence, highlighting the ‘carbon spike’ from building production. Relating the results to existing benchmarks for buildings’ GHG emissions in the Swiss SIA energy efficiency path shows that most cases exceed the target of 11.0 kgCO2eq/m2a. Considering global GHG reduction targets, these results emphasize the urgent need to reduce GHG emissions of buildings by optimizing both operational and embodied impacts. The analysis further confirmed a need for improving transparency and comparability of LCA studies. © 2019 The Authors","Buildings; Construction; Embodied carbon; Environmental impacts; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Life cycle assessment (LCA)","Buildings; Climate change; Construction; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Climate change mitigation; Embodied carbons; Energy efficient building; Energy performance; GHG reductions; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle GHG emissions; Operational energy; Greenhouse gases; building; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; transparency","Passer, A.; Working Group Sustainable Construction, Waagner-Biro-Straße 100/XI, Austria; email: alexander.passer@tugraz.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

The review covers contribution of integrated fertility management to mitigate climate change and sustain agricultural production. Combined application of farmyard manure and mineral fertilizer is very economical than sole NP application in maintaining sustainable agricultural productivity. Maximum sustained crop production (2.88 t/ha) was obtained when 69 kg of NP fertilizer was applied with 10 t/ha farmyard manure. Combined application of tie ridge, farmyard manure and NP fertilizer contribute for agricultural sustainability. Applying integrated soil fertility increase total nitrogen and available phosphorus in the soil for agricultural sustainability. The highest carbon (12 mg/kg) was sequestered when farmyard manure was applied with NP fertilizer on maize and wheat cropped alfisoils. Application of integrated fertility management reduces N2O emissions by increase nitrogen-use efficiency. Application of animal manure and NPK fertilizer reduce CH4 into the atmosphere contributing for climate change mitigation. Integrated soil fertility management improves soil fertility contributing for agricultural sustainability. Crop yield was improved by application of integrated fertility management which sustains agriculture.

Within the Barents Region, the increase has been ca. 2 degrees, and warming is expected to continue over the next century. Based on energy system analysis with the TIMES-VTT model on the one hand, and a literature review on the other, this study identifies how different economic sectors in the Barents Region are affected by changes in climate, and by the climate change mitigation and adaptation actions in the region. According to the results, the Barents region is likely to be strongly affected by the impacts of climate change despite high spatial variation in the impacts across the Barents region. Changing climate will have severe impacts especially on the more vulnerable sectors, societies, and local environments that have less possibility for adaptation. Political action is needed on national, regional, and municipal levels, but these levels should work together and complement each other. As adaptation is unavoidably required, it is important to highlight and suggest priority areas to national adaptation plans from the Barents region’s perspective. Moreover, collection and utilization of local knowledge in adaptation is crucial. © 2020 The Author(s).

Wet technology sectors have been developed rapidly in the global market. Currently, there is already a clear increase in freshwater scarcity. According to the UN, over 1.2 billion people live under constant growth of freshwater scarcity, and FAO predicts that the number of those living in water scarcity conditions will exceed 4 billion people [1] by the middle of the third decade of the XXI century. As far as is known, G. Rodda, as early as 1997, offered an ascending global water consumption curve (under 3 possible scenarios) and a descending curve of economically available water resources. Already existing factors of negative anthropogenic impact on water sources (pollution, depletion due to unacceptably high water intake, draining of raised bogs with the inevitable depletion of small rivers fed by raised bogs, deforestation watershed, etc.) were taken into account [2]. The analysis shows that the curves of water consumption and available resources intersect in 2035-2045 (depending on the scenario). It is projected that, considering the water consumption level over the past 10 years, which has grown 10 times, the amount of available resources is decreasing more rapidly than during the period taken as the basis for extrapolation. Thus, with appropriate adjustments, the intersection is anticipated in 2025-2030. In recent decades, freshwater scarcity has been increasing in regions where it did not exist before and is aggravating everywhere. The obvious reason is the increased water consumption by the growing population and economy. However, if the issue was limited only to this reason, only relative indicators of water availability (not necessarily real consumption) would deteriorate: amount of water resources per capita and per unit of output. However, fresh water of satisfactory quality is shrinking, not only in relative but also in absolute terms. This fact is often underestimated, and sometimes goes unnoticed. Nevertheless, it allows understanding the essence of the water scarcity widening process and determining the basic principles of strategy which will allow the developing mankind to solve a problem. To analyse it, it is necessary to start with the natural science aspect, and then move to the economic and political aspects. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change “Vulnerability is the degree, to which a system is susceptible to, or unable to cope with adverse effects of climate change, including climate variability and extremes”. When a trend towards decreased precipitation and runoff coincides with a trend towards higher water consumption or deteriorated water quality, then the given region or river basin may turn out to be vulnerable in near or remote future. A methodology for assessment of water resources vulnerability at different climate scenarios and future water demand is developed, in international projects of the National Institute of Meteorology and Hydrology. One part of the investigations are on the river basin level, another – on the transnational (South East Europe, SEE) and national level. For realistic assessment of the availability and vulnerability of water resources Guidance for identification of strategic issues is applied. Critical areas are defined as where global water exploitation index is above an appropriate threshold or water shortages frequently occur. Therefore, now or in the future, drinking water supply (DWSUP) is at risk directly or indirectly (conflict with other use). Changes in climate (CC) and land use may either sharpen already critical conditions. As a result, the strategic issues (SI) and areas of strategic importance are identified: (SI1) Large aquifers with critical exploitation index, groundwater dependent ecosystems are degraded, etc.; (SI2) DWSUP from small and medium springs, rivers and/or reservoirs is often limited during droughts. CC may produce more frequent droughts; (SI3) Relatively high exploitation index. During droughts alternative water resources should be used; (SI4) DWSUP of large cities, etc. The adaptive capacity of natural and socioeconomic systems is considered. Some investigations concerning the significance of trends in runoff change and runoff formatting factors are carried out using the Mann-Kendall Test. Base on the results some management options for mitigating vulnerability are proposed. The results and application in practice are related to the River Basin Management Plans (RBMP) and adaptive management for the purposes of WFD and Natura 2000. © 2020 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

A change of the industrial landscape and a partial transformation of energy supply have contributed to reductions so far, but for deep reductions, a deep transformation of the country's industrial metabolism is needed. While energy efficiency is well established, the same cannot be said for material efficiency, which includes product light-weighting, lifetime extension, more intense use, and value retention strategies like higher recycling rates, remanufacturing, and reuse. Sector-specific research showed substantial energy and emissions savings potentials of material efficiency, but the overall material efficiency potential for most world economies, including Germany, is unknown. We applied an open-source and modular dynamic material flow analysis model of the transformation of passenger vehicles, residential buildings, and commercial and service buildings in Germany (together ca. 50% of national greenhouse gases) to a material-efficient system, covering the time span 2016–2060. The potential impact of the above-mentioned material efficiency strategies was studied for the climate-relevant materials concrete, steel, timber, aluminum, and plastics. Once the potentials of energy-efficient products, electrification of end-use sectors, and energy system transformation are seized, supply and demand side material efficiency and sufficiency can reduce remaining 2050 emissions by an additional 19–34 % (passenger vehicles), 27–31% (residential buildings), and 14–19% (non-residential buildings). The 2016–2050 cumulative savings can be up to 750 Mt (million metric tons) CO2-eq. Material efficiency can be a key contributor to deep emissions cuts like a 95% target.

The pressure for increased biodiversity conservation is also increasing due to climate change, but effective management must consider climate change impacts when managing nature reserves. Nature reserves require adaptive management techniques to cope with climate change threats, but to date, there are no management evaluation tools for the mitigation and adaptation of climate change globally. In the past half century, Guangxi’s temperature has risen continuously and extreme weather events have increased in frequency, seriously impacting Guangxi biological habitats. This paper suggests the management effectiveness assessment tool of mitigation and adaptation on climate change (MEATMACC), based on the management effectiveness tracking tool (METT), to use as a management framework to mitigate and adapt to climate change in nature reserves. This paper also evaluated and analyzed 12 nature reserves in Guangxi by using both evaluation tools. National nature reserves scored 28.98% and 43.91% higher (METT and MEATMACC) than non-national nature reserves, respectively. MEATMACC scores were significantly different between national and non-national nature reserves but no significant differences in METT scores. Additionally, the scoring rate of METT and MEATMACC is linearly correlated without significant differences. There is highly significant difference in three elements’ scoring rate that context, planning and outcomes between METT and MEATMACC. The results show that policy and technical support for climate change mitigation and adaptation in nature reserve still needs to be strengthened. © 2020, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Therefore, mitigation and adaptation actions and measures have become increasingly necessary to preserve individual and collective well-being. The psychological distance is one of the main psychological constructs that explains the most concrete or abstract perception of the objects and events surrounding people. The psychological distance is a multidimensional construct, and in accordance with the construal level theory (CLT), temporal, hypothetical, spatial, and social distance are considered the most critical dimensions. This systematic review aims to provide an update of the literature on the role of psychological distance in the commitment to engagement mitigation and adaptation attitudes toward climate change. Method: The review was carried out following PRISMA guidelines and a systematic search was performed on PubMed, Psycinfo, Web of Science, Cochrane, and Scopus databases. Results: Nineteen articles have been identified as being eligible for the final synthesis. Results showed, in general, that individuals have a higher propensity to perform pro-environmental and resilient behaviors against climate change when it is perceived as more proximal and concrete within the construct of psychological distance. However, not all studies show this result. Some studies showed that, despite people considering climate changes as real and tangible, they do not perform mitigation and adaptation behaviors. Other studies showed that people implement these behaviors despite perceiving climate changes as distal and abstract. Conclusions: The current literature shows the existence of a relation among psychological distance and pro-environmental and resilient behaviors applied to climate change. For a deeper understanding of the conflicting results that emerged, more studies are necessary to explore the possible presence of further psychological variables involved in the relation within psychological distance, mitigation, and adaptation in environmental contexts. © 2020 Maiella, La Malva, Marchetti, Pomarico, Di Crosta, Palumbo, Cetara, Di Domenico and Verrocchio.","Adaptation; Climate change; Construal level theory; Environmental attitudes; Mitigation; Pro-environmental behavior; Psychological distance; Resilient behavior",,"Marchetti, D.; Department of Psychological, Italy; email: d.marchetti@unich.i",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",16641078,,,,"English","Front.

In a nutshell, the cost of improving irrigation system is USD 159.7 million in Bangladesh, 224 million in India, 9.1 million in Nepal, 38.5 million in Pakistan and 10.4 million in Sri Lanka. The proposed adaptation strategy can save more than USD 76.43 billion in the region after fulfilling the region's commitment toward the global mitigation efforts. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","adaptation; climate change; dynamic CGE; Fossil fuels; mitigation",,"Zeshan, M.; Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU)Norway; email: muh.zeshan@gmail.com",,"World Scientific",02175908,,,,"English","Singap.

The Mann-Kendall (MK), Sen's slope test estimator, and innovative trend detection (ф) (ITA) methods were used to detect the trends. According to the findings, average annual precipitation shows a descending trend (ф = -0.17) in most stations. An increasing trend was found only in Fuyang station (ф = 1.02). In all stations, the trends of mean annual temperature (ф = 0.36) were abruptly increased. During the past 57 years, the mean air temperature has considerably increased by 12°C/10a. The river streamflow showed a dramatic declining trend in all stations for the duration of the study period (1960-2016) (ф = -4.29). The climate variability in the study region affects the quantity of the streamflow. The river streamflow exhibits decreasing trends from 1965 onwards. The main possible reason for the declining stream flow in the study area is the declining amount of precipitation on some specific months due to the occurrence of climate change.

The present investigation adopts a person-context interaction approach to provide such a comparison and demonstrates the influences of societal-level factors. We propose that some sociocultural contexts tend to be more agentic, allowing people to express their internal attributes, including climate change concern, whereas some contexts tend to be more restrictive, hindering people from doing so. With two international datasets, we observed that the association between climate change concern and mitigation behaviour was stronger among societies with higher levels of self-expression affordance (indicated by lower levels of disease threat and higher levels of governance quality, economic development, and individualism). These results indicate the importance of considering not only individual-level determinants but also societal-level factors in the study of people’s behavioural response to climate change. They also offer insights into how environmental practitioners and decision makers can promote mitigation behaviour. © 2020 The Authors.

Therefore, additional, preferably instantaneous, measures are needed for quick emission reductions, which is where material efficiency (ME) could constitute a promising solution. ME strategies include but are not limited to vehicle lightweighting through material substitution, increased recycling of materials, reuse and remanufacturing of vehicle components, vehicle downsizing (switching to a smaller vehicle), and more intensive use by means of increased vehicle occupancy through sharing practices. While recent analyses have focused on a narrow subset of ME strategies, we find striking differences in the overall potential of different measures to decrease vehicular carbon footprints. Downsizing and more intensive use offer the largest mitigation potential but strongly depend on consumer behavior and are highly sensitive to modeling assumptions. Combined, the analyzed strategies can achieve emission reductions of up to 57% over the life cycle of a single vehicle, which is comparable to up to 83% achieved through a shift to low-carbon energy supply. ME can cut carbon footprints of already efficient vehicles charging renewable electricity by half again. This makes ME both an excellent short-term solution for climate change mitigation targeting the light-vehicle sector but also an important complementary strategy to the long-term transition toward electric vehicles and renewable energy supply.

Observing the impact of climate change on the construction industry, this paper examines sustainable architectural design as a tool to mitigate climate change. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the previous goal, the authors conduct a comprehensive documentary analysis of three types of sources: (1) scholarly articles in the fields of climate research, sustainable construction, green buildings and sustainable architecture; (2) contemporary global reports on climate change and its impact on the built environment and (3) practitioners' guides explaining practical architectural solutions to the climate crisis. Findings: The systematic analysis provides three types of results: objectives, strategies and principles of sustainable architectural design aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change. On the one hand, the research results provide a solid basis for further conceptual research into architectural design responsive to the effects of changing climate. On the other hand, the detailed strategies and principles are relevant for urban designers and architects. Originality/value: Among a range of literature in the field of climate change and its effects on the built environment, a particular value of the paper is in addressing a very local level, i.e. the level of individual building and its immediate surroundings. More specifically, this paper provides concrete design components that help reduce CO2 emissions, finally decreasing the vulnerability index of urban systems. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Built environment; Climate change; CO2 emission; Construction industry; Green building; Sustainable architecture",,"Sijakovic, M.; TTArchitectsUnited Kingdom; email: milansijakovic@gmail.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",26316862,,,,"English","Archnet-IJAR",Article,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089825155

Climate change causes more frequent occurrences of floods and droughts, which can cause major damage to agriculture and the environment. Ameliorative measures in hydrotechnical amelioration include protection from flood and catchment waters, drainage of surplus water land and irrigation (Soskic et al, 2001). Protection of a certain area from flooding and catchment water implies hydrotechnical measures and solutions aimed at preventing or diminishing harmful effects and consequences of surface runoff of large amounts of precipitation or torrents water from higher elevations to lower parts, as well as consequences of flooding events from watercourses and other water bodies in the riparian and a wider area. Drainage of surplus water from a land area can be achieved by designing an adequate drainage system (hydro‒ameliorative drainage system) consisting of different technical solutions and structures: pumping stations channels/pipes for various purposes, of different dimensions and shapes, additional structures/equipment and infrastructures (roads, bridges). For the purpose of preventing or mitigating droughts as a natural occurrence that causes a shortage of water in the soil (rhizosphere), an amelioration measure of irrigation should be provide favourable soil moisture condition for plant growth and development where there is lack of precipitation in an area. Successful agricultural production can be achieved if there is a favourable water-air ratio in the soil during the growing season, as excess or shortage of water in the soil causes a decrease in yield. At aimed preventing/mitigation the consequences of climate change in agriculture and the environment, existing (built) hydro-technical facilities, surface and underground drainage systems as well as irrigation systems should be adequately used and maintained, and continue with activities for the construction of new hydro-technical facilities and drainage and irrigation systems. © 2020, University of Montenegro.

It is concluded that high salinity altered many metabolic processes due to high osmotic potential inside the cell which is considered an alarming situation for the forthcoming climate change in Pakistan and required climate-smart agriculture to lower the negative impact forthcoming salinization, before it might affect global crop production drastically. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","antioxidant enzymes; Capsicum annum L; chlorophyll; osmolytes; Priming technique; protein","carotenoid; climate change; crop production; enzyme activity; germination; global warming; nutrient uptake; salinity; salinization; seedling; sodium chloride; Pakistan; Capsicum annuum; Capsicum annuum var. annuum","Ullah, S.; Department of Botany, Pakistan; email: sami_jan69@yahoo.com",,"Taylor and Francis Inc.",00103624,,CSOSA,,"English","Commun.

Adopting a public choice perspective, we argue that its engagement can be understood as a response to the joint goal of reputational and financial benefits. The detailed empirical account of the Bank’s activities–from its pioneering role through the Prototype Carbon Fund in the early 2000s, to its initiatives for upscaled crediting subsequent to the 2015 Paris Agreement–is broadly in line with this interpretation. The period between 2005 and 2011 most clearly shows that the Bank was ready to forego some reputational benefits for the sake of financial benefits. During this period, it followed a flourishing privately driven carbon market, mostly competing with, rather than catalysing, private activities. After the Paris Agreement opened the door for a new phase of carbon markets, the Bank again took up a pioneering role, now focusing on the public sector. However, since transparency in relation to its activities is limited–thus reducing reputational risk–these activities may not meet the quality standards, notably with respect to additionality, that are a precondition for carbon markets to be an effective tool for climate change mitigation. Key policy insights Over time, the World Bank has alternated between being an ‘agenda setter’, catalysing private and public sector engagement in carbon markets, and a ‘regime follower’ regarding international carbon markets, based on varying reputational and financial benefits. In the post-Paris climate regime, the Bank has resumed its original pioneering role, although the scale of its activities is smaller, and they are less transparent, than during the Kyoto Protocol period of the early 2000s. To maximize its contribution, the Bank can act as a source of initial demand for carbon credits, but must have an exit strategy in place once the private and public sector gets sufficiently involved. Sufficient transparency on the Bank’s activities is required; reputational considerations provide an incentive to support generation of high-quality carbon credits. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon credits; International carbon markets; Kyoto Protocol; Paris Agreement; World Bank","climate change; environmental management; environmental policy; financial system; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol; policy implementation","Shishlov, I.; Igor Shishlov Perspectives Climate Research, Hugstetter Strasse 7, Germany; email: shishlov@perspectives.cc",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

In recent years, climate activists have also become more vocal in characterizing the failure of the global community to reduce emissions as a serious ethical breach that must quickly be rectified. Nevertheless, emissions continue to increase. It seems clear that there remain critical constituencies who do not perceive an urgent need or acknowledge an ethical obligation to implement stronger measures to mitigate climate change. In this article, I argue that (1) a strong ethical obligation to reduce emissions of CO2 and other GHGs can be derived from a few widely accepted ethical principles and (2) broader recognition of this ethical obligation can help overcome impediments to collective action. I also seek to show that arguments commonly made in opposition to stronger climate change mitigation efforts do not withstand ethical review.

These frameworks lack a common understanding of biofuels’ sustainability and climate performance. The ETD’s minimum tax rates do not differentiate fuels according to their climate performance and has no relevance for greenhouse gas emission reduction in the transport sector. At the same time, the RED instruct EU Member States to promote biofuels that meet its sustainability criteria. As shown by the case studies in this article, this comes with challenges for Member States’ tax incentives to biofuels in relation to State aid law. In principle, governments may freely structure incentives according to national (climate) policy objectives. Yet, that freedom is restricted by State aid law, and national objectives are typically overlooked when incentives are assessed in State aid procedures. © 2020, Kluwer Law International.

In the last few decades, the massive area has devastated due to commercial shrimp and fish ponds development. To rehabilitate the coastal ecosystems, some mangrove has been planted with spacing distances of 1x1 m with minimal forest management. Those dense-spaced stands enhanced light competitions and inhibit growth. These poor quality and immature stands that reach an early climax in 10-15 years were observed in two adjacent sites near Nam Dinh and Thanh Hoa in northern Vietnam, where Kandelia candel were planted. To cultivate the resurgent stands and increase their growth, thinning mangrove is essential. Stand densities of the mangrove trees with and without the thinning practice were 17,800 and 5,200 trees ha-1, respectively. Their potential of the maximum above-ground biomass were 303 and 239 Mg ha-1, respectively. However, quality of the single tree was largely different whether or not thinning practice is conducted, as the thinned one of 46 kg tree-1 was about three times higher than the non-thinned of 17 kg tree-1. The thinning practice enhances stand biomass growth with improved growth condition in the forest, which advances carbon sequestration for the climate change mitigation. The cultivated trees also ensure the climate change adaptation of coastal protection, fishery products and bio-diversity. Synergizing mitigation and adaptation strategies with the mangrove thinning would enhance the benefits for coastal communities most vulnerable to climate change. © APAC 2013.All rights reserved.","Biomass; Coastal ecosystem rehabilitation; Mangrove plantation","Ecosystems; Fish; Fish ponds; Forestry; Shore protection; Above ground biomass; Adaptation strategies; Carbon sequestration; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Coastal communities; Coastal protection; Thinning practices; Climate change",,"Suriamihardja D.A.Harianto T.Abdurrahman M.A.Rahman T.","Hasanuddin University Press",,9789795301257,,,"English","Proc.

The amount and quality of excretion depends on factors such as food, animal species, production status, health status and type of facilities. Integrated models for waste management should consider the revaluation of these as raw material, in order to develop technologies that enable the recovery of nutrients. Pig waste silage, compost, vermicompost, and anaerobic digestion systems are part of these schemes. On the other hand, the importance of bioremediation lies in the use of the metabolic potential of microorganisms to transform organic pollutants, and can be used to clean contaminated spaces or water.

In addition to rainfall during major hurricane and tropical storm events, coastal cities like New Orleans and Houston are vulnerable against high intensity short-duration rainfall events. Located below sea level and subjected to regional ground subsidence, New Orleans relies on their pumps and canals to handle one inch of rain the first hour, half-An-inch every hour thereafter. Aging and poorly maintained infrastructure systems can increase the amount of storm runoff to an already strained drainage system, creating pockets of flooding in ill-equipped and vulnerable neighborhoods. Using existing elevation certificates, BFE, regional subsidence rate, and inundation statistics from recent flooding events, this paper evaluates effects of subsidence on property elevation and long-Term repetitive loss potential of the structures.

The extraction and combustion of fossil fuels continues apace, resulting in continual rising of greenhouse gas emissions, which pose a threat to all life on earth. However, the global climate regime continues to underestimate the need for immediate, radical and powerful action. Dominant framings of the problem continue to emphasise behaviour change rather than system change, and fail to challenge the power of fossil-fuel capital. This failure makes it difficult to be optimistic about the future but there may be hope in a new kind of politics based on non-violent direct action and mass civil disobedience. This form of action is directed at delegitimising fossil fuels and stopping their extraction, and acting as a 'radical flank' in positively influencing political decision-making towards a democratically agreed just transition. © Policy Press 2020.","Civil disobedience; Climate change; Climate policy; Direct action; Environmental justice; Environmental policy; System change","climate change; environmental management; environmental planning; environmental policy; leadership; mitigation","Somerville, P.; University of LincolnUnited Kingdom; email: psomerville@lincoln.ac.uk",,"Policy Press",03055736,,,,"English","Policy Polit.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084202827

In China, essential elements of the Chinese legal tradition and an institutionalized devolution of power from the central government to local governments essentially neutralized the Chinese variant of the ppp in one important context by mobilizing certain culturally defined behavioural norms at the local level. In India, the Supreme Court has behaved in accordance with the socially revolutionary role intended for it by the framers of India's Constitution by recognizing a maximalist conception of the ppp as part of Indian law, although other features of India's unique legal culture and institutions have reduced the impact of this development. In the United States, the institutionalized fragmentation of the law-making process within the Federal Government has undermined even the implicit implementation of the ppp, to which US environmental statutes do not refer. The implications of these developments for the ppp as an instrument of municipal but also global environmental governance in climate change mitigation law flow less from the nominal status of the ppp in the laws of China, India, and the United States than from the unique institutional and cultural conditions that prevail there. The result is a case study in how institutions and culture can transform the implementation of a principle of environmental governance that at first glance might seem to be a simple exercise in economic rationality into a different exercise that is not simple at all. © 2020 by Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, The Netherlands..","China; cultural norms; India; polluter pays principle; United States",,"Barresi, P.A.; School of Arts and Sciences, United States; email: P.Barresi@snhu.edu",,"Brill Academic Publishers",18786553,,,,"English","Clim.

Many countries have been establishing increasingly stringent and ambitious targets in support of transport electrification. We conducted scenario simulations to depict the role of transport electrification in climate change mitigation and how the transport sector would interact with the energy-supply sector. The results showed that transport electrification without the replacement of fossil-fuel power plants leads to the unfortunate result of increasing emissions instead of achieving a low-carbon transition. While transport electrification alone would not contribute to climate change mitigation, it is interesting to note that switching to electrified road transport under the sustainable shared socioeconomic pathways permitted an optimistic outlook for a low-carbon transition, even in the absence of a decarbonized power sector. Another interesting finding was that the stringent penetration of electric vehicles can reduce the mitigation cost generated by the 2 °C climate stabilization target, implying a positive impact for transport policies on the economic system. With technological innovations such as electrified road transport, climate change mitigation does not have to occur at the expense of economic growth. Because a transport electrification policy closely interacts with energy and economic systems, transport planners, economists, and energy policymakers need to work together to propose policy schemes that consider a cross-sectoral balance for a green sustainable future. © 2020 The Author(s).

In California, high commodity prices and increased frequency of drought have encouraged orchard turnover, providing an opportunity to recycle tree biomass in situ prior to replanting an orchard. Whole orchard recycling (WOR) has potential as a carbon (C) negative cultural practice to build soil C storage, soil health, and orchard productivity. We tested the potential of this practice for long term C sequestration and hypothesized that associated co-benefits to soil health will enhance sustainability and resiliency of almond orchards to water-deficit conditions. We measured soil health metrics and productivity of an almond orchard following grinding and incorporation of woody biomass vs. burning of old orchard biomass 9 years after implementation. We also conducted a deficit irrigation trial with control and deficit irrigation (-20%) treatments to quantify shifts in tree water status and resilience. Biomass recycling led to higher yields and substantial improvement in soil functioning, including nutrient content, aggregation, porosity, and water retention. This practice also sequestered significantly higher levels of C in the topsoil (+5 t ha-1) compared to burning. We measured a 20% increase in irrigation water use efficiency and improved soil and tree water status under stress, suggesting that in situ biomass recycling can be considered as a climate smart practice in California irrigated almond systems. © 2020 Jahanzad et al.

It analyses the benefits derived from an overall green urban regeneration, including green roofs, green façades and sustainable urban drainage. This would contribute to both climate change adaptation and mitigation solutions, including the following: reduction in cooling and heating demand; bio-retention of stormwater and consequently ameliorating risks of floods; reducing hot spots which create urban heat island and improving urban health. This paper first categorizes green urban infrastructure solutions. It analyses a series of case studies conducted in Germany, Spain, Canada and the USA; in order to identify the contribution to mitigate and adapt to climate change. It develops a set of measurable figures which define the contribution of an overall green urban solution intervention. It applies this assessment specifically to an urban space of Amurrio (Araba, Spain) and to an existing building of Balmaseda (Bizkaia, Spain). It finally analyses evaluation tools for governments and planning institutions to improve planning strategies and policy developments.

Most of the wastewaters generated from either domestic or industrial sources are still discharged without adequate treatment processes, and impact on the environment and public health. The objective of this paper was to provide a comprehensive literature review on the application of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in treating a variety of wastewaters, discussing its feasibility in pollutant removal efficiency and additional benefit in climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. The following results were obtained: 98%, 96%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 88% for BOD5, COD, TSS, TN, NH4 –N, PO43-respectively in Kenya; 98.46% and 98.55% for COD and BOD5 in Indonesia; and ranges from 94-99.9%, 91.7-97.9% and 99.99% for BOD5, COD and TFC respectively in Costa Rica. Whereas in Ethiopia, the HSSFCW achieved the following abatement efficiencies: COD ranges from 58 to 80%, BOD ranges from 66 to 77%, TKN ranges from 46-61%, sulfates ranges from 53 to 82%, and NH4 – N range from 64 to 82.5% for tannery wastewater treatment. For domestic wastewater treatment; 99.3%, 89%, 855, 84.05%, 77.3%, 99% and 94.5% were achieved for BOD5, COD, TSS, TN, PO4 3-, TP, Sulfate, and TFC, respectively. In addition to improving water quality, CWs have a CSP. For example, CWs showed CO2 equivalent of 4119.54 g C/m2/yr CSP (carbon sequestration potential) which is 15118.7118 g CO2. The methane equivalent to this amount of carbon sequestration is 604.748472 g/m2/yr. Generally, research results indicated that constructed wetlands are efficient wastewater treatment techniques and should be encouraged for wastewater management as a strategy to reduce wastewater pollution. However, constructed wetland performance efficiency sustainability is affected by the operational conditions of HSSFCW including plant species, media/substrate types, water depth, hydraulic loading, and hydraulic retention time and feeding mode. © 2020, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","And greenhouse gases; Carbon cycle; Carbon sequestration potential; Climate mitigation; Constructed wetland; Horizontal subsurface flow; Performance evaluation; Wastewater",,"Wu, Z.B.; School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, China; email: wuzb@ihb.ac.cn",,"Corvinus University of Budapest",15891623,,,,"English","Appl.

A critical analysis of past and current climatic trends from an existentialist lens is equally axiomatic to that effect. Countries all over the world particularly developing countries face manifest extreme weather and other climate-related impacts on asymmetric scales. Therefore, it is now patent that climate change reality is no longer a contested global issue. The problem however remains how to effectively manage it. This concern over the years resulted in two major climate policies: mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation has popularly received more focus and emphasis, as all countries are required to put their best efforts in combating climate change. This is true even as adaptation was originally perceived to be an inconsequential concept likely to preposterously impede global mitigation efforts. Nonetheless, there is high uncertainty with regards to detectable and measurable result from global efforts in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. More so, differences in climate variability and its impacts question how mitigation policy in a global context can achieve inclusiveness, bearing in mind that climate impacts are locally felt. This study re-examines the relevance of mitigation and adaptation policies in a need-based context and scale of experience of some countries or regions with regards to climate change variability and its impacts. Specifically, it argues that disparities in climate impacts trigger a growing inevitable need demanding a more prioritized reactive adaptation option over mitigation policy for certain countries or regions that are ever extremely vulnerable to climate change. The study adopts a qualitative analysis approach by building its argument on existing literature. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate change management strategy; Climate change policies; Mitigation",,"Nwedu, C.N.; Department of Criminology and Security Studies, P.M.B. 1010, Nigeria; email: cosmosnike.nwedu@gmail.com",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079797302

We present a systematic literature review that highlights the increasing interest from academics and practitioners in using quality management philosophies for addressing sustainability issues. From the analysis carried out, it is clear that Lean is being used in this regard but the potential of Six Sigma is not being exploited. Taking advantage of the best of both approaches (Lean Six Sigma) can contribute to reducing energy consumption in industrial processes and contribute to mitigating the impacts of those processes on climate change.

The eco-biological impacts could be viewed across various dimensions including loss of biodiversity as well as ecosystem goods and services, changes in phenology, prevalence of droughts and forest fires, disease outbreaks, reduced crop yields and increase in intensity and frequency of extreme weather events. Although, the natural ecosystems are innately endowed with the ability to maintain homeostasis by means of resistance and resilience, this ability to cope up is severely impacted by various other factors like deforestation, habitat fragmentation, land-use change and biological invasion, which exacerbate the effects of climate change. The eco-biological impacts of climate change are tied with socio-economic aspects by means of market values of the produce, poverty, undernourishment, livelihood security, etc. At this crucial juncture, forest biomes offer an immense ecosystem service towards climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. Nevertheless, the three major forest biomes, viz. tropical, temperate and boreal, with their unique characteristics, vary in their response to climate change as well as mitigation potential and response. This review chapter aims to understand the varied climate change impacts and the crucial roles of major forest biomes in climate change mitigation and their various ecological services to formulate better forest management strategies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Deforestation; Forest biomes; Socio-economic aspects","Biodiversity; Deforestation; Economics; Ecosystems; Extreme weather; Land use; Anthropogenic activity; Carbon sequestration; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Extreme weather events; Forest biomes; Habitat fragmentation; Socioeconomic aspects; Climate change","Khan, M.L.; Biodiversity Conservation Lab, India; email: khanml61@gmail.com",,"Springer",18635520,,,,"English","Environ.

However, dynamic biophysical and biogeochemical processes that operate at local scales are seldom studied in conjunction with structural ecosystem properties that arise from broad environmental constraints. As a result, the effect of SPA interactions on how ecosystems respond to, and exert influence on, the global environment remains difficult to predict. Scope: We review recent findings that link structural and functional SPA interactions and evaluate their potential for predicting ecosystem responses to chronic environmental pressures. Specifically, we propose a quantitative framework for the integrated analysis of three major plant functional groups (evergreen conifers, broadleaf deciduous, and understory shrubs) and their distinct mycorrhizal symbionts under rising levels of carbon dioxide, changing climate, and disturbance regime. First, we explain how symbiotic and competitive strategies involving plants and soil microorganisms influence scale-free patterns of carbon, nutrient, and water use from individual organisms to landscapes. We then focus on the relationship between those patterns and structural traits such as specific leaf area, leaf area index, and soil physical and chemical properties that constrain root connectivity and canopy gas exchange. Finally, we use those relationships to predict how changes in ecosystem structure may affect processes that are important for climate stability. Conclusions: On the basis of emerging ecological theory and empirical biophysical and biogeochemical knowledge, we propose ten interpretive hypotheses that serve as a primary set of hierarchical relationships (or scaling rules), by which local SPA interactions can be spatially and temporally aggregated to inform broad climate change mitigation efforts. To this end, we provide a series of numerical formulations that simplify the net outcome of complex SPA interactions as a first step towards anticipating shifts in terrestrial carbon, water, and nutrient cycles. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon-water relations; Emerging properties; Numerical modeling; Resource limitation; Soil-plant-microbe feedbacks; Spatiotemporal scaling; Symbiosis",,"Silva, L.C.R.; Environmetal Studies Program, United States",,"Springer",0032079X,,PLSOA,,"English","Plant Soil",Review,"Article in Press","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079240122

It contains high organic and carbon content which can be reused/diverted for useful products (like Biochar) that facilitate climate change mitigation. Biochar, a renewable carbon, is gaining importance and it opens up an area of research to explore on the properties and stability of biochar, its wide applications, impacts on soil characteristics, techno-economic details, carbon and nitrogen interactions of biochar-soil matrix, and emission control. This review addresses opportunities of biomass wastes for biochar production, various thermo-chemical reactions for preparation and its basics/mechanisms, properties of biochar and hydrochar, and gaps/operational challenges, and summarizes wide applications of biochar in soil improvement, climate change mitigation, energy production, waste management, and environmental remediation. The effect of physico-chemical parameters (temperature, heating rate, chemical composition, etc.) on the biochar production will help in valorizing this industry. The optimized process conditions involved in low temperature (torrefaction, microwave-assisted pyrolysis, hydrothermal carbonization), pyrolysis (Fast, Slow, Flash), gasification, and combustion processes for biochar, syngas, and bio-oil production are to be explored. The critical review on the biochar addition influence on CO2, CH4, and N2O emissions in various soil types and carbon sequestration is done here. The modification and activation of biochar are recently attractive due to their role in improving biochar quality and for expanding its applications. Limitations and future status of biochar production from biomass waste are highlighted.

While compact urban forms with public transit are viewed as important strategies for reducing emissions, environmental benefits must be weighed against the costs of public transit infrastructure, road improvements to alleviate congestion in dense urban space, and more expensive housing resulting from land use restrictions. The literature largely lacks a theoretical framework for assessing these tradeoffs. This paper derives analytical insights into urban land use and transportation planning for climate change mitigation by formulating a social planner's utility maximization problem. The planner chooses the residential densities of urban zones as well as investments in road and public transit infrastructures that link these zones to the city center. Road travel is subject to congestion. Any feasible solution must accommodate a fixed total population and ensure that residents of all zones have the same maximum utility. GHG emissions associated with housing, road travel, and public transit generate damages. Analytical results show that incorporating GHG damages into urban planning always leads to an optimal solution with a more compact urban form, and reduces automobile travel in each zone if a specific condition involving the marginal congestion cost and the marginal effectiveness of road investment is satisfied. Numerical examples demonstrate that near-optimal emissions reductions and utility improvements can be achieved via public transit investment and mode shifting even if the planner inherits and cannot modify a suboptimal land use and road configuration. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Land use; OR in environment and climate change; Policy analysis; Transportation; Urban planning","Climate change; Cost reduction; Economics; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Investments; Land use; Motor transportation; Roads and streets; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Urban planning; Climate change mitigation; Environmental benefits; Land-use restrictions; Policy analysis; Rapid urbanizations; Theoretical framework; Transportation planning; Utility maximizations; Urban transportation",,,"Elsevier B.V.",03772217,,EJORD,,"English","Eur J Oper Res",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077694830

The case of CFLs indicates that home climate practices beyond light bulbs can add up to significant work, particularly when they require the navigation of toxic or complex shifts in materiality, specialized knowledge, and uncertainties.

This review is a sectorial evaluation of climate change mitigation and adaption approaches in Pakistan in the aforementioned sectors and its economic costs which were identified to be between 7 to 14 billion USD per annum. The research suggested that governmental interference is essential for sustainable development of the country through strict accountability of resources and regulation implemented in the past for generating state-of-the-art climate policy. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; GHG emissions; Mitigation; Sectorial effects","Animals; Biodiversity; Energy security; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Financial resources; GHG emission; Mitigation; Sectorial effects; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; economic impact; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; natural hazard; state role; sustainable development; agriculture; climate change; environmental factor; environmental impact; food security; forestry; human; livestock; natural disaster; Pakistan; public policy; Review; social adaptation; social responsibility; socioeconomics; weather; animal; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; flooding; forest; Pakistan; Animalia; Agriculture; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Floods; Forestry; Forests; Humans; Livestock; Pakistan","Yousaf, B.; CAS Key Laboratory of Crust-Mantle Materials and the Environments, China; email: balal@ustc.edu.cn",,"Springer",01676369,,EMASD,"31844992","English","Environ.

Understanding political feasibility requires answering three questions: (a) “Feasibility of what?,” (b) “Feasibility when and where?,” and (c) “Feasibility for whom?.” In relation to the 1.5°C target, these questions translate into (a) identifying specific actions comprising the 1.5°C pathways; (b) assessing the economic and political costs of these actions in different socioeconomic and political contexts; and (c) assessing the economic and institutional capacity of relevant social actors to bear these costs. This view of political feasibility stresses costs and capacities in contrast to the prevailing focus on benefits and motivations which mistakes desirability for feasibility. The evidence on the political feasibility of required climate actions is not systematic, but clearly indicates that the costs of required actions are too high in relation to capacities to bear these costs in relevant contexts. In the future, costs may decline and capacities may increase which would reduce political constraints for at least some solutions. However, this is unlikely to happen in time to avoid a temperature overshoot. Further research should focus on exploring the “dynamic political feasibility space” constrained by costs and capacities in order to find more feasible pathways to climate stabilization.

The research also included examining the effects of environmental water-related adaptation technology and climate change mitigation patents on real gross domestic product. The results contribute to the literature on technology transfer policies by highlighting how environmental patents influence Europe's economic growth rate and whether countries’ geographical location can affect their level of entrepreneurship and innovation.

CO2 direct air capture (DAC) is among the most promising negative emission technologies (NETs). The energy demands for low-temperature solid-sorbent DAC are mainly heat at around 100 °C and electricity, which lead to sustainably operated DAC systems based on low-cost renewable electricity and heat pumps for the heat supply. This analysis is carried out for the case of the Maghreb region, which enjoys abundantly available low-cost renewable energy resources. The energy transition results for the Maghreb region lead to a solar photovoltaic (PV)-dominated energy supply with some wind energy contribution. DAC systems will need the same energy supply structure. The research investigates the levelised cost of CO2 DAC (LCOD) in high spatial resolution and is based on full hourly modelling for the Maghreb region. The key results are LCOD of about 55 €/tCO2 in 2050 with a further cost reduction potential of up to 50%. The area demand is considered and concluded to be negligible. Major conclusions for CO2 removal as a new energy sector are drawn. Key options for a global climate change mitigation strategy are first an energy transition towards renewable energy and second NETs for achieving the targets of the Paris Agreement. © 2019, The Author(s).","100% renewable energy; CO2 direct air capture; Energy transition; Maghreb; Negative emission technology","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; climate change; electricity; electricity industry; energy resource; global climate; spatial resolution; Maghreb","Breyer, C.; Lappeenranta University of Technology, Skinnarilankatu 34, Finland; email: Christian.Breyer@lut.fi",,"Springer",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

L.) and barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) were established as cover crops and compared to the traditional fall-winter fallow between two irrigated cash crops, maize (Zea mays L.) and sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.). The global warming potential (GWP) balance included direct and indirect (nitrous oxide (N2O) resulting from the deposition of ammonia (NH3) or from leached nitrate (NO3 −)) soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) and albedo, and carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq) emissions from inputs, irrigation and farm operations. Several scenarios involving i) changes in the termination method of the cover crops, ii) consideration of the application of a distinct nitrogen (N) source (urea, slurry or manure instead of ammonium nitrate) or nitrification inhibitors, iii) employing the same N rate for all treatments (i.e., conventional instead of integrated fertilization), iv) modelling SOC accumulation over a 100-year horizon, and v) using default emission factors, were also analysed. Under the conditions of our experiment, cover crops mitigated yield-scaled emissions by 77.4% (barley) and 91.9% (vetch). Synthetic N fertilization (particularly the industrial production of fertilizer) contributed 38% to the balance of the cover cropping treatments, followed by SOC (22.5%), irrigation (14.7%) and albedo (14.5%). All scenarios led to notable mitigation efficacies, ranging from 39% mitigation (in barley when considering default or non-specific emission factors) to a net CO2eq sink (i.e., &gt;100% mitigation) in the scenario consisting of the replacement of ammonium nitrate by urea or organic fertilizers although with side effects on NH3 volatilization and/or yields. Based on these results, the combined use of cover cropping and integrated soil fertility management could lead to the design of C-neutral irrigated cropping systems in semi-arid regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Carbon sequestration; Catch crop; Conservation agriculture; Green manure; Life cycle assessment","Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Crops; Gas emissions; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Irrigation; Life cycle; Manures; Metabolism; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Solar radiation; Urea; Urea fertilizers; Carbon sequestration; Catch crops; Conservation agricultures; Green manures; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Greenhouse gases","Guardia, G.; ETSI Agronómica, Ciudad Universitaria s/n, Spain; email: guillermo.guardia@upm.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The quantification of lifestyle and household consumption impacts upon carbon emissions from both the embodied CO2 (EC) and materially retained carbon (MRC) viewpoints is critical to deriving amelioration policies and meeting emission reduction goals. This study, for the first time, details a methodology to estimate both EC and MRC for Japan, focusing on petrochemicals and woody products utilizing the time series input-output table, physical value tables and the national survey of family income and expenditure, leveraging time series input-output-based material flow analysis (IO-MFA), and structural decomposition analysis (SDA). Findings elucidated hot spots of deleterious consumption by age of householder and the critical factors which underpin them including intensity effects, pattern effects, and demographic shifts over time. Although demographic shifts associated with an aging, shrinking population in Japan decreased EC and MRC, the negative effect reduced in size over time during 1990-2005. Policy implications identify the potential to mitigate approximately 21% of required household emission reductions by 2030 through strategies including recycling initiatives and the recovery of carbon from products covered within current recycling laws and hot spot sectors which are not currently considered such as apparel.

In the urgency of current circumstances, ecosystem restoration represents a range of available, efficient, and effective solutions to cut net greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Although mitigation success can be measured by monitoring changing fluxes of greenhouse gases, adaptation is more complicated to measure, and reductions in a wide range of risks for biodiversity and people must be evaluated. Progress has been made in the monitoring and evaluation of adaptation and mitigation measures, but more emphasis on testing the effectiveness of proposed strategies is necessary. It is essential to take an integrated view of mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity, and the needs of people, to realize potential synergies and avoid conflict between different objectives. © 2019 The Authors.",,"adaptive management; biodiversity; climate change; environmental monitoring; environmental restoration; measurement method; mitigation; strategic approach; terrestrial ecosystem; biodiversity; carbon footprint; climate change; ecosystem restoration; human; review","Morecroft, M.D.; Natural EnglandUnited Kingdom; email: mike.morecroft@naturalengland.org.uk",,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",00368075,,SCIEA,"31831643","English","Sci.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076457841

Although numerous studies have examined factors that influence individuals' mitigation behaviours, much less attention has been given to interpersonal influence. Children have been suggested to influence parents' climate change concerns; however, how the interactions between couples-typically the primary decision-makers in married-couple households-influence each other's climate change concerns has seldom been discussed. In this study, we surveyed married heterosexual couples to investigate the interdependency of husbands' and wives' motivations for behavioural change to mitigate climate change. We found that wives' psychological constructs, including climate change risk perception, self-efficacy, and gender role attitudes, demonstrated stronger effects on their husbands' motivation than did husbands' own constructs on their own motivation, whereas husbands' psychological constructs did not influence their wives' motivation. Our results suggest the importance of wives' role in motivating household climate change mitigation behaviours. © 2019 The Author(s).

These global food loss and waste (FLW) annually generate 4.4 Gt CO2-eq, or about 8% of total anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and thus present a still underestimated driver of climate change. To date, little is known about grassroots initiatives dedicated to reducing and preventing FLW and their actual potential to prevent FLW and thus contribution to mitigate GHG emissions. This paper presents a systematic review that examined the peer-reviewed evidence on grassroots initiatives' potential to limit food waste and GHG emissions. We found 15 relevant studies which represent a small but recent and growing interest in the topic. The findings of the studies are mostly of a qualitative nature, exploring the initiatives' organizational structure, goals and available resources. This systematic review highlights a pressing need for further research and impact measurement to better assess the role of grassroots initiatives in FLW reduction and climate change mitigation. It raises main directions for future research. © 2020 The Author(s).

Typically, these diets are high in plant-sourced and low in animal-sourced and processed foods. Despite the fact that their environmental impacts vary, they are often referred to as 'sustainable diets'. Here we systematically review the available published evidence on the effect of 'sustainable diets' on environmental footprints and human health. Eight databases (OvidSP-Medline, OvidSP-Embase, EBSCO-GreenFILE, Web of Science Core Collection, Scopus, OvidSP-CAB-Abstracts, OvidSP-AGRIS, and OvidSP-Global Health) were searched to identify literature (published 1999-2019) reporting health effects and environmental footprints of 'sustainable diets'. Available evidence was mapped and pooled analysis was conducted by unique combinations of diet pattern, health and environmental outcome. Eighteen studies (412 measurements) met our inclusion criteria, distinguishing twelve non-mutually exclusive sustainable diet patterns, six environmental outcomes, and seven health outcomes. In 87% of measurements (n = 151) positive health outcomes were reported from 'sustainable diets' (average relative health improvement: 4.09% [95% CI -0.10-8.29]) when comparing 'sustainable diets' to current/baseline consumption patterns. Greenhouse gas emissions associated with 'sustainable diets' were on average 25.8%[95%CI -27.0 to -14.6] lower than current/baseline consumption patterns, with vegan diets reporting the largest reduction in GHG-emissions (-70.3% [95% CI: -90.2 to -50.4]), however, water use was frequently reported to be higher than current/baseline diets. Multiple benefits for both health and the environment were reported in the majority (n = 315[76%]) of measurements. We identified consistent evidence of both positive health effects and reduced environmental footprints accruing from 'sustainable diets'. The notable exception of increased water use associated with 'sustainable diets' identifies that co-benefits are not universal and some trade-offs are likely. When carefully designed, evidence-based, and adapted to contextual factors, dietary change could play a pivotal role in climate change mitigation, sustainable food systems, and future population health. © 2020 The Author(s).

Biochar has also attracted attention as a soil amendment capable of improving yield and soil quality and of reducing soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this work, we review the literature on biochar production potential and its effects on climate, food security, ecosystems, and toxicity. We identify three key factors that are largely affecting the environmental performance of biochar application to agricultural soils: (1) production condition during pyrolysis, (2) soil conditions and background climate, and (3) field management of biochar. Biochar production using only forest or crop residues can achieve up to 10% of the required CDR for 1.5 °C pathways and about 25% for 2 °C pathways; the consideration of dedicated crops as biochar feedstocks increases the CDR potential up to 15-35% and 35-50%, respectively. A quantitative review of life-cycle assessment (LCA) studies of biochar systems shows that the total climate change assessment of biochar ranges between a net emission of 0.04 tCO2eq and a net reduction of 1.67 tCO2eq per tonnes feedstock. The wide range of values is due to different assumptions in the LCA studies, such as type of feedstock, biochar stability in soils, soil emissions, substitution effects, and methodological issues. Potential trade-offs between climate mitigation and other environmental impact categories include particulate matter, acidification, and eutrophication and mostly depend on the background energy system considered and on whether residues or dedicated feedstocks are used for biochar production. Overall, our review finds that biochar in soils presents relatively low risks in terms of negative environmental impacts and can improve soil quality and that decisions regarding feedstock mix and pyrolysis conditions can be optimized to maximize climate benefits and to reduce trade-offs under different soil conditions. However, more knowledge on the fate of biochar in freshwater systems and as black carbon emissions is required, as they represent potential negative consequences for climate and toxicity. Biochar systems also interact with the climate through many complex mechanisms (i.e., surface albedo, black carbon emissions from soils, etc.) or with water bodies through leaching of nutrients. These effects are complex and the lack of simplified metrics and approaches prevents their routine inclusion in environmental assessment studies. Specific emission factors produced from more sophisticated climate and ecosystem models are instrumental to increasing the resolution and accuracy of environmental sustainability analysis of biochar systems and can ultimately improve the characterization of the heterogeneities of varying local conditions and combinations of type feedstock, conversion process, soil conditions, and application practice. © 2019 by the authors.","Biochar; Biogeochemical cycles; Biophysical effects; Carbon dioxide removal; Climate mitigation; Environmental assessment; Food security; Life-cycle assessment; Negative emission technology; Pyrolysis",,"Tisserant, A.; Industrial Ecology Programme, Norway; email: alexandre.tisserant@ntnu.no",,"MDPI AG",2073445X,,,,"English","Land",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079775956

These lands are an important source of food for the global population. This review paper examines the impacts of climate change on managed temperate grasslands and grassland-based livestock and effectiveness of adaptation and mitigation options and their interactions. The paper clarifies that moderately elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2) enhances photosynthesis, however it may be restiricted by variations in rainfall and temperature, shifts in plant's growing seasons, and nutrient availability. Different responses of plant functional types and their photosynthetic pathways to the combined effects of climatic change may result in compositional changes in plant communities, while more research is required to clarify the specific responses. We have also considered how other interacting factors, such as a progressive nitrogen limitation (PNL) of soils under eCO2, may affect interactions of the animal and the environment and the associated production. In addition to observed and modelled declines in grasslands productivity, changes in forage quality are expected. The health and productivity of grassland-based livestock are expected to decline through direct and indirect effects from climate change. Livestock enterprises are also significant cause of increased global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (about 14.5%), so climate risk-management is partly to develop and apply effective mitigation measures. Overall, our finding indicates complex impact that will vary by region, with more negative than positive impacts. This means that both wins and losses for grassland managers can be expected in different circumstances, thus the analysis of climate change impact required with potential adaptations and mitigation strategies to be developed at local and regional levels. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Ecosystem health; Food security; Grassland; Grazing system; Livestock; Mitigation","adaptive management; agricultural land; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem health; food security; grassland; grazing; greenhouse gas; growing season; livestock farming; plant community; rainfall; Animalia","Ghahramani, A.; Centre for Sustainable Agricultural Systems, Australia; email: afshin.ghahramani@usq.edu.au",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078457009

In Ethiopia, where the majority of the population rely on agriculture, climate change has adverse effects. In rural areas, low resilient capacity to shocks exacerbates the impacts of climate change such as production failure, which in turn enormously contributed to food insecurity. In view of this fact, this study assessed the perceptions and practices of climate change and related adaptation and mitigation strategies among farmers in the Konta Special District, Southern Ethiopia, by using a mixed research approach involving a concurrent method of data collection and analysis. Quantitative data for this study was generated from 296 randomly selected survey households; while, qualitative data was collected through focus group discussions, key informant interviews, and in-depth interviews. The findings of this study revealed that sample respondents recognized the occurrence climate change and its increasing adverse effects. Regarding its cause, a substantial proportion (46.8%) of the respondents perceived climate change as the wrath of God and a natural phenomenon rather than attributing it to human activities. Participants also acknowledged that anthropogenic factors such as deforestation are the major driving factors for climate change. The study found that farmers affirmatively perceive the feasibility of the majority of the strategies embraced in the Climate Resilient Green Economy initiative endorsed at national level. Understanding that climate change effects are less reversible, farmers were found to practice mitigation strategies such as afforestation, agroforestry and agricultural intensification more than adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies such as fuel conservation technologies were perceived costly and complex given the economic capacity and skill of farmers. Hence, rural and agricultural development policies should initiate context sensitive adaptation and mitigation strategies to enhance the capability of smallholders to deal with the effects of climate change. © 2019 Copyright by University of Silesia in Katowice","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation; Perception; Vulnerability",,"Tesema, D.; Department of Sociology, Ethiopia; email: derejetesema2011@gmail.com",,"De Gruyter Open Ltd",23540079,,,,"English","Environ.

The application of the MyLake-Sediment model to boreal Lake Vansjø illustrates the model's ability to reproduce daily water quality variables and predict sediment-water column exchange fluxes over a long historical period. In prognostic scenarios, we assessed the importance of sediment processes and the effects of various climatic and anthropogenic drivers on the lake's biogeochemistry and phytoplankton dynamics. First, MyLake-Sediment was used to simulate the potential impacts of increasing air temperature on algal growth and water quality. Second, the key role of ice cover in controlling water column mixing and biogeochemical cycles was analyzed in a series of scenarios that included a fully ice-free end-member. Third, in another end-member scenario P loading from the watershed to the lake was abruptly halted. The model results suggest that remobilization of legacy P stored in the bottom sediments could sustain the lake's primary productivity on a time scale of several centuries. Finally, while the majority of management practices to reduce excessive algal growth in lakes focus on reducing external P loads, other efforts rely on the addition of reactive materials that sequester P in the sediment. Therefore, we investigated the effectiveness of ferric iron additions in decreasing the dissolved phosphate efflux from the sediment and, consequently, limit phytoplankton growth in Lake Vansjø. ©2019.

In Ethiopia, there are inadequate data in the form of carbon accumulation records or databank to assess the carbon sequestration potential of different forests. This study intended to estimate the living biomass and carbon stocks of woody plants in Chilimo-Gaji Forest. Totally, 10 circular plots with 20 m radius each having 1,256 m2, estimated the biomass of 17 tree species using the nondestructive allometric equation. The total woody biomass of the study area estimated to be 1013.3 t ha-1, of which, about 83.3 % (844.4 t ha-1) was aboveground, and 16.7% (168.9 t ha-1) was below ground biomass. The total carbon stocks and total carbon sequestration potential of the study area was about 506.7 t C ha-1 and 1859.45 t ha-1, respectively. The result indicates that the Chilimo-Gaji Forest has huge potential for carbon stock compared to research conducted on other remnant forests in Ethiopia. This is mainly due to the improvement in the forest stocks as a result of participatory forest management practices in the area. Generally, Chilimo-Gaji Forest is playing a vital role in carbon sequestration, thereby contributing to climate change mitigation. Therefore, in the future, the forest can generate carbon credits as financial benefits to the indigenous population, which could help to strengthen the conservation efforts of forest resources in the study area. © 2019 SAAB","Allometric equation; Ethiopia; Forest carbon; Tree biomass","allometry; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation status; forest resource; tropical forest; woody plant",,,"Elsevier B.V.",02546299,,SAJBD,,"English","S.

Urban land planning shapes the urban form and is considered to be an effective approach for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Yet, there is little knowledge about what urban forms can reduce both greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate stresses while considering trade-offs between them. Here, we investigate the role of urban land use in both climate change mitigation and adaptation. In particular, we assess quantitatively the competition between strategies for mitigation and adaptation and identify potential win-win solutions in land use responses. Using a coastal city as a case study, we find that the land use strategies for unilateral mitigation or adaptation can cause contradicting consequences with respect to the reductions in GHG emissions and climate stresses, i.e. reductions in GHGs could increase climate stresses or vice versa. Poorly integrated strategies potentially may compromise international efforts to meet the Climate Action in the Sustainable Development Goals. Properly integrated mitigation and adaptation strategies, or climate-sensitive land use planning, however, can lead to win-win outcomes and eventually achieve co-benefits. Yet, any co-benefits will gradually diminish if there is a delay in climate-sensitive land use planning, implying growing GHGs and intensified climate stresses. Our analysis indicates that integrating climate change mitigation and adaptation in urban land use needs to be enacted as soon as possible: any delays in implementation reduce the window to act to maximize the co-benefits. © 2019 The Authors","Adaptation; Coastal cities; Mitigation; Trade-offs; Urban land use","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Planning; Adaptation; Coastal cities; Mitigation; Trade off; Urban land use; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; coastal zone; empirical analysis; land use planning; mitigation; trade-off; urban area; article; carbon footprint; city; climate change; competition; empiricism; quantitative analysis; stress; sustainable development; urban area; acclimatization; city; city planning; human; sea; Acclimatization; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Humans; Oceans and Seas","Cui, S.; Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, China; email: shcui@iue.ac.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",01604120,,ENVID,"31648155","English","Environ.

While this was an important step for the global community, much work remains to be done. Based on climate change and technology scenarios developed by the International Energy Agency in the wake of the agreement, the World Bank has developed a set of projections about the amount and kind of feedstock materials that will be required to achieve these targets in the years ahead. So-called “technology minerals”—including metals like lithium and cobalt that are commonly found in rechargeable batteries, or tellurium that is used to make solar cells—figure prominently. An important aspect of the Paris Agreement is the need for the world economy to shift away from fossil fuels towards green energy networks based on stored electricity and renewable energy sources. But achieving the agreement's ambitious goals will necessarily require dramatic increases in global production rates for technology minerals that are far beyond current levels. Despite the urgent need for these feedstock materials, however, the mineral supply sector is not on track to satisfy anywhere near this demand. To put the industry and its supporting institutions on a path more likely to deliver these vital materials, this paper recommends a more integrated, global, system-wide approach to managing the organizations behind technology minerals: the Smart Mineral Enterprise Development (SMED) framework. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Mining; Public-private partnerships; Smart; Technology minerals",,"Perrons, R.K.; Queensland University of Technology, GPO Box 2434, Australia; email: perrons@alum.mit.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

Reducing the concentration of such gases with sequestering mechanism on the surface of the land helps to treat the problem. One of such methods is trapping carbon in the form of soil organic carbon (SOC) together with sediments, by implementing sediment trapping practices. Direct field measurements, calculations and laboratory analysis were used. Results: The result shows that sediment storage dams (SSDs) sequestered/trapped ~ 60.97*10 3 t of sediment with the SOC content ranged from 14 to 87 g kg − 1 and check dams (CDs) trapped 7.8*10 3 t of sediment with the SOC content ranged from 20 to 290 g kg − 1 . In general, the studied SSDs and CDs sequestered ~ 44.68*10 5 kg of SOC together with ~ 68.8*10 6 kg of sediment. In this study, SSDs and CDs were found to be important SOC sequestering practices together with sediments. Conclusions: Thus, it is concluded that soil and water conservation structures can be used as carbon sequestering methods to reduce the concentration of GHGs in the atmosphere in addition to reducing soil erosion. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Soil and water conservation structures; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matter",,"Addisu, S.; Bahir Dar University, Ethiopia; email: soladd2000@yahoo.com",,"Springer",21978670,,,,"English","Geoenvironmental Disasters",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065700556

Most farmers in the study area are highly aware of climate change and its consequences on the farming system; however, mitigation strategies are clearly lacking. Among the mitigation, mechanism to reduce the threat is achieved by increasing the amount of carbon sinks and reducing greenhouse gas emission through the adoption of agroforestry practices. The purpose of this study is to determine if awareness on climate change leads to the adoption of agroforestry practices, and to examine the determinants. Design/methodology/approach: A total number of 117 questionnaires were administered to the farmers in the district using stratified random sampling technique. Data were captured and analysed using STATA and XLSTAT software. Descriptive statistics and Heckprobit sample selection model were used to determine the objectives of the study. Findings: The result established that climate change awareness does not lead to the adoption of agroforestry in the study area in which information source and member’s association were statistically significant at (p < 0.1) and (p < 0.05), respectively, and determine the adoption of agroforestry practices, while farming experience (p < 0.1), age (p < 0.05), extension visit (p < 0.05) and education (p < 0.1), were the determining factors that influence the awareness of climate change in the study area. Practical implications: Regular number of extensions visit, information and training on agroforestry should be provided to the farmers in the study area. Social implications: Farmers’ association should be strengthened among the rural farmers. Originality/value: The causal effect or relationship of climate change awareness on mitigation through the practice of agroforestry in South Africa, especially in the study area, has not been measured. This research set a pace in the area of climate change awareness leading to mitigation strategies through the use of agroforestry practices as an option to be used in the rural farming area of South Africa. © 2019, Oluwaseun Samuel Oduniyi and Sibongile Sylvia Tekana.","Agroforestry practices; Climate change awareness and mitigation; Heckprobit sample selection model; North West Province of South Africa","agroforestry; climate change; farming system; greenhouse gas; strategic approach; South Africa","Oduniyi, O.S.; Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, South Africa; email: sammiey2007@yahoo.com",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17568692,,,,"English","Int.

Adding fossil fuel energy to the agricultural system can increase productivity through the use of manufactured fertilizer but creates greenhouse gas emissions. This study quantifies an alternative in which energy is added to the agricultural system through a substitution of solar energy for fossil fuel energy by the tree species Faidherbia albida. This substitution can be quantified as an avoided emission of greenhouse gas, a climate benefit. F. albida trees have unusual phenology, leafing out during the dry season and shedding leaves in the rainy season. In agroforestry systems, F. albida adds nutrients and organic matter to the soil through leaf drop, and these are beneficial to the crop growing under the tree canopy. Dormant during the cropping season, they do not compete for light, water or nutrients, and contribute nitrogen to the soil under their canopy. This nitrogen benefit is analyzed in relation to an equivalent quantity of urea fertilizer. This is a substitution of solar energy that the trees use to obtain nitrogen from the atmosphere, for the fossil fuels used in the manufacture and transport of urea fertilizer. This energy contribution by the tree, within the food energy and water system, enhances the food production, and resilience of the system, as soil organic matter increases available water for the plants. This energy contribution to the Ethiopian farming system is estimated as 3.48 GJ ha−1 year−1, based on the nitrogen contribution. Greenhouse gas emissions are avoided by the substitution of solar energy for fossil fuel energy, a climate change mitigation benefit estimated as 0.116 tons CO2 ha−1 year−1. This mitigation is fundamentally different from sequestration of carbon in biomass or soil organic matter. It is a permanently avoided emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, associated with a particular cropping year, and is not reversible, unlike carbon stored in biomass or soil organic matter that could return to the atmosphere. The potential extent of F. albida agroforestry is substantial and its potential climate change mitigation benefits are great. © Copyright © 2019 Haskett, Simane and Smith.","agroforestry; avoided emissions; climate change adaptation and mitigation; Ethiopia; evergreen agriculture; Faidherbia albida; food energy water nexus; nitrogen fertilization",,"Haskett, J.D.; Energy Resources and Environment Program, United States; email: Jhaskett314@gmail.com",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2296665X,,,,"English","Front.

A remaining question is whether the experience of an extreme weather event increases climate change concern via experiential learning or reinforces existing views via motivated reasoning. Building on this work, we explore the relationship between personal experience and climate change policy preferences using surveys in 10 communities that experienced extreme weather events (3 tornadoes, 3 floods, 2 wildfires, 1 hurricane and 1 landslide). We find that self-reported personal harm aligns with objective measures of event impacts and that personal harm (i.e., experience) is associated with higher levels of policy support. However, we do not find that objective measures of event impacts are related to policy support. Though political ideology (i.e., motivated reasoning) dominates our model of policy support in predictable ways, personal harm moderates this relationship suggesting that conservatives reporting higher levels of personal harm from the event are, on average, more likely to express support for climate policy than those reporting lower levels of harm. We postulate that while extreme weather events may serve as teachable moments on climate change, their lessons may only reach conservatives who feel personally harmed, even in the communities most affected. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change policy; Extreme weather events; Personal experience; Public opinion","climate change; environmental policy; extreme event; hazard management; hurricane; learning; nature-society relations; political ideology; public attitude; weather forecasting","Zanocco, C.; Civil and Environmental Engineering, United States; email: czanocco@stanford.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

There is a need to develop a model that is stable and that provides evidence of an objective burden sharing rule so that the environmental agreement is more acceptable. This study approaches this problem via a cooperative game at the global level to make International Environmental Agreements (IEA) more stable. For this purpose, we apply the Shapley value transfer mechanism and find that under the commitment scenario, some regions attain the maximum benefits by joining the coalition. Shapley value transfer improves the coalition size and increases the global benefits at a certain level of abatement under perfect cooperation. Imperfect cooperation leads to lower levels of global benefits. Our findings offer new implications on how to improve the international cooperation for climate change. Commitments by major regions could activate the IEA (e.g., Paris agreement) efficiently. For the maximum global response to climate change, the national governments must reformulate and implement policies to meet their intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs).

Yet, their achievement depends on sustainability targets compatible across different sectors and scales. Our study examines how the GHG emission intensity of agriculture (EIA) should evolve globally, regionally (Western Europe) and nationally (The Netherlands) under different socioeconomic pathways, so that two major aims of SDGs 2 and 13 (i.e. sufficient food production and climate change mitigation) are achieved simultaneously. Results show that, by 2050, relative to 2010 values, EIA should decrease at all three levels when measured on a product basis (GHG emissions per ton dry matter) and on a land basis (GHG emissions per ha). This indicates that, globally, agriculture should be intensified per unit area, while in Western Europe and even more so in the Netherlands additional emission reductions require increased production efficiency and lower production volumes. Projected reductions in methane and nitrous oxide emissions from enteric fermentation, manure management and fertilizer application in Dutch agriculture are much higher than what would be achieved through the extrapolation of current trends. Given the high costs of increasing production efficiency further, our analysis indicates the need for significantly more ambitious policy targets and systemic changes, including reduced consumption of animal-sourced food. Besides shedding light on the interaction between climate and agricultural strategies, our analysis illustrates the application of cross-scale thinking in the operationalization of the SDG agenda and underscores the need for concerted action amongst countries. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Cross-scale analysis; Scenario analysis; Sustainable Development Goals; Trade-offs","climate change; fertilizer application; food production; scenario analysis; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; Netherlands; Western Europe; Animalia","Daioglou, V.; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment AgencyNetherlands; email: vassilis.daioglou@pbl.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

In Australia, coastal wetlands have been transformed to ‘ponded pasture’ for cattle grazing which has resulted in a loss of saline wetlands, increased methane emissions, and impacts on species like fish and birds. Reconversion of these areas to saline wetlands is a potential climate change mitigation strategy, but given they occur at the intersection of private and public ownership regimes, some specific legal issues must be considered. This article provides an analysis of the legal enablers and barriers associated with reconverting ponded pastures or other hydrologically modified coastal land to saline wetlands for climate change mitigation, using Queensland, Australia as a case study. While projects are clearly possible, some of the key factors to consider in order to reduce legal risk and liability include: whether the law permits reflooding and what permits are required; clarifying land and carbon rights, which may require negotiation with the state government; and understanding the liabilities for potential impacts on adjacent land and biota. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Blue carbon; Law; Ponded pasture; Saltmarsh","climate change; coastal wetland; land use planning; ownership; pasture; saltmarsh; Australia; Queensland; Aves; Bos","Bell-James, J.; TC Beirne School of Law, Australia; email: j.bell-james@law.uq.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",02648377,,,,"English","Land Use Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072246679

The simultaneous implementation of climate change mitigation (SDG 13) and forest protection (SDG 15) is an example of an interaction where the measures/policies that contribute to both goals can be identified and the overlaps eliminated. However, there are limited studies that quantitatively evaluate the synergy potential in the forest sector. This study is the first attempt to examine the synergy potential in the forest sector in Indonesia focusing on climate change mitigation and forest protection. We evaluated four scenarios that differentiated climate and forest policy options and assessed the effectiveness of implementing these two policies simultaneously by 2030, using a computable general equilibrium model and a land-use model. We found that the additional efforts needed for emission reduction were larger for the scenario not considering forest protection than for that considering forest protection. This caused differences in the mitigation measures introduced and the resulting land use that depended on the scenario. Consequently, mitigation costs would be reduced by implementing mitigation and forest protection policies simultaneously, suggesting that the synergy effect in the forest sector in Indonesia does exist.

Particularly, vulnerable groups are hit harder by heat waves. A gender-sensitive perspective has not been taken into account sufficiently in scientific studies on climate change and health. This study examined the health impact of extreme heat events from a gender-sensitive perspective and measured gender-specific individual behavioural adaptation and mitigation strategies. A cross-sectional population survey was done in Leipzig, Germany, from July to October 2014. The survey was used to determine the relationship between the influencing factors such as gender, adaptive and mitigation measures and the health burden resulting from extreme heat waves. Gender-specific differences were found for type of income, personal net income and individuals who are strongly affected by persistent heat. A significant gender difference was also found for headaches, cardiovascular diseases, different climate adaptation measures and types of mitigating behaviour. These findings confirm other study results and indicate the need for further studies on gender and diversity aspects which take into account sociodemographic, socioeconomic and climate ecological differences. Taking the public health approach, surveys for adaptation and mitigation measures are needed which explicitly consider gender and target groups’ aspects. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate change; Gender; heat wave; public health","adaptive management; climate change; extreme event; gender; health impact; heat wave; public health; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony","McCall, T.; Faculty of Health Sciences, Germany; email: timothy.mc_call@uni-bielefeld.de",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17565529,,,,"English","Clim.

By contrast, scholars have shown little interest in exploring the case of cross-boundary adaptation spillovers, where adaptation by one country affects other countries. Two decades of the economic literature on climate mitigation may contribute to bridge this research gap because the problem structure of climate mitigation resembles that of adaptation with cross-boundary spillovers. With this in mind, we ask the following research question: Are there lessons to be learned by applying a mitigation perspective to the governance of adaptation with cross-boundary spillovers? After reviewing the relevant adaptation and mitigation literature, the paper applies mitigation insights to an adaptation case with cross-boundary spillovers: climate change-induced eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. Insights on coalition structures, side-payments, issue-linkage, and trade sanctions provide novel perspectives on the governance structures in place. To improve cooperation on providing adaptation as a public good, smaller regional governance arrangements could be more effective, European subsidies for pollution control might be redirected, and progress on eutrophication could be made a precondition for cooperation on other areas. These perspectives depart both from the way the Baltic Sea eutrophication problem is addressed at present, and from the way public goods are addressed in the adaptation literature. They show that some lessons can indeed be learned, calling for further research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Baltic Sea; Climate mitigation; Governance arrangements; Public goods; Spillovers; Transnational adaptation","adaptive management; climate change; conceptual framework; cross-border relations; environmental economics; environmental policy; governance approach; literature review; mitigation; multinational enterprise; public goods; spillover effect; strategic approach","Roggero, M.; Humboldt-Universität zu BerlinGermany; email: matteo.mancini.roggero@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",15679764,,,,"English","Int.

Given that the energy sector is the major source of the greenhouse emissions in these countries, the framework of sustainable energy development indicators was applied to the comparative analysis. The analysis revealed the differences among the groups of countries in terms of greenhouse gas emission profiles and development trends of these profiles. The convergence of greenhouse gas emission profiles can be noticed between G7 and BRICS countries during 1990–2017 period. Greenhouse gas emissions per capita has decreased in G7 countries and increased in BRICS countries. Energy intensity, economic growth and carbon factor are the main drivers of greenhouse gas emissions per capita growth in both groups of countries. Carbon factor represents carbon intensity of a country's energy sector and is measured by greenhouse gas emissions per unit of total primary energy supply. The impact of carbon factor was least significant among the main drivers in both groups. Energy intensity was the major driver of decrease in greenhouse gas emissions per capita for both groups, however, the economic growth exceeded the contribution of energy intensity in BRICS countries and greenhouse gas emissions have increased in this group during investigated period. The comparative analysis of greenhouse gas emission profiles development trends and the main drivers of these trends in both groups of countries provides important insights in shaping future climate change mitigation policies and developing greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Due to the high greenhouse gas profiles, low GHG reduction commitments and insufficient climate change mitigation the Perform, Achieve and Trade (PAT) scheme in India efforts in both groups there is danger of postponing implementation of Paris commitments and achieving the 1.5° target. The policies implemented in high ranked countries, like or Integrated Resources Planning in South Africa or measures under Energy efficiency directive in EU can be applied in low ranked countries by providing the substantial contribution to the country's climate targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BRICS; Climate change mitigation; Energy; G7; Greenhouse gas emission profile","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; BRICS; Climate change mitigation; Energy; Global climate changes; Greenhouse emissions; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Integrated resources planning; Sustainable energy development; Climate change","Streimikiene, D.; Lithuanian Energy Institute, Breslaujos 3, LT, Lithuania; email: dalia@mail.lei.lt",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Mitigating the effects of climate change is crucial for minimizing the occurrence of hazards associated with climate change. Adapting to this new climate era is important for the continued existence of life on planet earth. This paper presents a review of climate mitigation and adaptation strategies with specific focus on the construction industry. It discusses the following climate mitigation and adaptation strategies: use of green energy, use of sustainable building materials, construction of high rise buildings and living building elements, use of innovative designs and construction methods and recycling of urban waste. The paper also argues that developing countries are most vulnerable to climate change effects but certain factors limit them from mitigating and adapting to climate change. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Cities are developing climate change action plans (CCAPs) focusing their efforts on reducing GHG emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. Despite having the highest urban population in the world, there are a few studies on urban CCAPs in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region. This study assessed the level of integration of mitigation and adaptation (IMA) in urban climate change plans across 44 major LAC cities. The level of IMA was measured by the utilization of the IMA index, a comprehensive evaluation framework of indicators. The results showed that more than half of the examined LAC cities have a moderate level of IMA. The study further explored and statistically analyzed 42 institutional, socioeconomic and environmental factors to identify which ones potentially drive or constrain the level of IMA. Five out of 42 factors were found to have a significant impact (p-value < 0.05) on the IMA index. Of the five significant factors, memberships in regional networks FLACMA and UCCI respectively, and donor agencies' contribution to the development of urban policies had a positive impact on IMA index; while the national climate fund and membership in the global network Urban LEDS had a negative impact. This suggests that cities are most likely to integrate mitigation and adaptation when the development of their CCAPs are supported by donor agencies or collaborating with other cities. The results highlight the important role of donor agencies, international organizations and cities' networks on providing the necessary capacity to cities for addressing climate change in an integrated manner. © 2019 The Author(s).

Forests can most easily work as carbon sinks. However, it is convenient to analyze the residence time of this carbon in forests, as this residence time will depend on the type of forest management used. This paper aims to analyze forest management models from a perspective of carbon residence time in forests, dividing the models into three types: carbon conservation, carbon storage, and carbon substitution. Carbon conservation models are those models in which the amounts of carbon stored only replace the carbon released, mainly by the industrial use of raw materials. Carbon storage models are models that foster the growth of forest areas to ensure that the amount of carbon stored grows, and where the ratio clearly leans towards sequestration and storage. Carbon substitution models are models that move towards the substitution of fossil carbon by renewable carbon, thus contributing to the creation of a neutral flow. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon conservation; Carbon flow models; Carbon storage; Carbon substitution; Climate change; Forest management","carbon sink; climate change; forest management; greenhouse gas; literature review; mitigation; residence time; sustainability","Nunes, L.J.R.; ICAAM-Instituto de Ciências Agrárias e Ambientais Mediterrânicas, Portugal; email: d39529@alunos.uevora.pt",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073634021

This research focuses on the Punjab province of Pakistan and evaluates the impacts and consequences of climate change on general public at local and divisional level. In order to cope with the impacts of climatic changes at all levels, especially divisional level, raising reliable awareness and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting measures is significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector is imperative. The impacts of climate change are observed across the country through gradual increase in temperature, human health issues, pest diseases, droughts, floods, and irregular weather patterns leading to changes in lifestyles, and these issues are likely to continue in the future. The main cause of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan, can be attributed to excessive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere due to human activities involving inefficient energy usage, rapid urban expansion, improper waste management, industrial development, increasing transportation, agricultural activities, and livestock mismanagement. The findings of this study revealed that transportation sector is the major source of GHG emissions in the country, followed by industrialization and waste, at national, as well as divisional, level. The extent of impacts of climate change at divisional level is distinguishable and displayed a direct relationship with climate, geography, variation of effects, and modes of production in various regions of Punjab. The study strategically investigated all nine divisions of the province for comprehensive understanding of climate change phenomenon, and the results indicated that nearly three-fourths of the respondents have never indulged in taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study adopted a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) approach where the findings can act as set of guidelines for governmental authorities in formulating, assisting in preparation, instructing, and guiding policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation at national, local, and divisional levels.

Despite both being simultaneously relevant to future agricultural systems, the two are usually studied separately. By contrast, this study jointly compares the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of mitigation policy on farming systems in the central region of Western Australia’s grainbelt, using the results of several biophysical models integrated into a whole-farm bioeconomic model. In particular, we focus on the potential for interactions between climate impacts and mitigation activities. Results suggest that, in the study area, farm profitability is much more sensitive to changes in climate than to a mitigation policy involving a carbon price on agricultural emissions. Climate change reduces the profitability of agricultural production and, as a result, reduces the opportunity cost of reforesting land for carbon sequestration. Nonetheless, the financial attractiveness of reforestation does not necessarily improve because climate change also reduces tree growth and, therefore, the income from sequestration. Consequently, at least for the study area, climate change has the potential to reduce the amount of abatement obtainable from sequestration – a result potentially relevant to the debate about the desirability of sequestration as a mitigation option. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","adaptation; agriculture; climate-change impacts; economics; emissions; interaction; mitigation; sequestration","adaptive management; agricultural emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; farming system; pollution tax; Australia; Western Australia","Kragt, M.E.; University of Western Australia School of Agriculture and Environment, Australia; email: marit.kragt@uwa.edu.au",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",1364985X,,,,"English","Aust.

While it is essential to understand the temporal dynamics of urban forest structure as well as its services and contribution to human wellbeing in cities, it has hardly ever been examined whether the future contributions of these services after different possible planting strategies can comply with climate change policy goals; these are topics rarely discussed in urban planning and management. In this paper, the ecosystem services currently provided by urban trees (through carbon sequestration and storage), as well as those potentially provided in the future, were quantified using the i-Tree Eco model, and their contribution to climate change mitigation was evaluated. As a case study in Tabriz, Iran, we developed four possible scenarios. Synergy (urban temperature regulation by UF) and trade-off (tree water requirements) were also analyzed. Future carbon sequestration and storage potential of urban trees was compared with the estimated future carbon emissions. The current contribution in Tabriz is relatively modest (about 0.2%), but it can be tripled through long-term tree planting strategies. Additionally, the temporal cooling effects and tree water requirements increase as climate change mitigation improves through tree planting. We conclude that urban tree planting has a small impact on carbon mitigation in the study area, most likely because of the young age of trees in Tabriz as well as the fact that the planted trees cannot deliver all their benefits over a 20-years period and need more time. Thus, the use of urban trees serves only as a complementary solution rather than an alternative climate mitigation strategy. Our quantitative approach helps urban environmental policymakers to evaluate how much they can rely on urban forest strategies to achieve climate change mitigation targets. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon storage and sequestration; Greenhouse gas emissions; I-tree eco; Synergy; Trade-off; Urban forest",,"Amini Parsa, V.; School of Environment, Iran; email: aminiparsa@ut.ac.ir",,"Springer New York LLC",10838155,,,,"English","Urban Ecosyst.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068331475

The literature scarcely covers the implications of stranded assets and resources for ‘latecomers’ to development. Hence, we address the question: What does a literature review of stranded resources and stranded assets in a diversity of fields imply for latecomers to development in the fields of climate change and global sustainable development? We find seven dimensions in the literature: (i) Spatial: where first comers use their own resources and resources of other countries for their own development leaving little environmental utilization space for latecomers to develop; (ii) Technological: when first comers ‘dump’ older technologies (stranded assets) on latecomers; (iii) Economic: when first comers avoid paying compensation for damage caused to latecomers or for the stranding of resources in latecomer countries; and first comers may potentially also indirectly transfer their soon to be worthless shares on latecomers; (iv) Ecological: when knowledge from first comers may prevent latecomers from using their resources/ or may accelerate the rate at which their resources and assets become stranded; (v) Political: when first comers refuse to take environmental action claiming that latecomers are not doing so; while latecomers may claim that first comers should take action first; (vi) Legal/Policy: when investments in resources and assets in a globalizing world involve long-term contracts protected under private law may cause policy freezing and liabilities in latecomers; and (vii) Social: when latecomers adopt different notions on development than first comers. Latecomers need to be sensible in deciding which resources to develop to avoid carbon lock-in and whether phasing-in renewables could avoid creating stranded assets in the first place. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon leakage; First comer-latecomer; North-South; Stranded assets; Stranded resources; Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)",,"Gupta, J.; University of Amsterdam, Nieuwe Achtergracht 166, Netherlands; email: J.Gupta@uva.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

Most related studies take a national or regional perspective on the impact of climate change. Taiwan is constrained by its geographical conditions, which increase its vulnerability to climate change, especially in its western coastal areas. The county that is most affected by climate change is Yunlin. In 2013–2014, projects that were sponsored by Taiwan’s government analyzed the relationship among synthesized vulnerability, ecological footprint (EF) and adaptation to climate change and proposed 15 categories of synthesized vulnerability and EF values. This study further examines the relationship between vulnerability and EF values and examines how residents of four townships—Linnei, Sihu, Mailiao, and Huwei—cope with the effects of climate change. This study investigates whether the residents of the four townships vary in their attitudes to climate change, their perceptions of disaster risk, and their behavioral intentions with respect to coping with climate change. The structural equation model (SEM) is used to examine the relationships among attitudes to climate change, perceptions of disaster risk, and the behavioral intentions of residents in townships with various vulnerabilities to climate change. The results that are obtained using the SEM reveal that climate change mitigation/adaptation behavior is affected by attitudes to climate change and perceptions of disaster risk. However, the effects of attitudes and perceptions on mitigation and adaptation that are mediated by place attachment are not statistically significant. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ecological footprint; Place attachment; Risk perception; Structural equation model; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone; disaster management; ecological footprint; governance approach; mitigation; perception; public attitude; vulnerability; Mailiao; Taiwan; Yunlin; attitude; climate change; comparative study; coping behavior; disaster; environmental protection; female; human; male; physiology; rural population; Taiwan; theoretical model; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Attitude; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Disasters; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Rural Population; Taiwan; Young Adult","Lee, Y.-J.; Chung-Hua Institution for Economic ResearchTaiwan; email: yungjaanlee@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",09441344,,ESPLE,"29423694","English","Environ.

For this purpose, we use a global non-radial distance function to examine the efficiency and abatement cost of carbon emissions and take China's Poyang Lake Ecological Economics Zone (PLEEZ), one of China's national strategy for sustainable development, as an empirical study. By using the non-radial efficiency model, the carbon emissions efficiency indicator can be constructed. By employing the dual model of the non-radial directional distance function, the shadow prices of carbon emissions, which is interpreted as marginal abatement cost can be derived. County level data from 2009 to 2013 of the PLEEZ is used as the empirical investigation. Empirical results show that the CO2 emissions of the PLEEZ are not performing efficiently and the CO2 emissions efficiency remains at a very low level with an average value of 0.279. Meanwhile, the shadow prices of CO2 emissions are calculated, with a mean value of 11.867 yuan per ton, which is relatively low compared with other previous studies of different regions or industry and indicate that carbon emissions are not strictly regulated. Moreover, significant heterogeneities in the carbon efficiency and abatement cost are found among three major functional zones in the PLEEZ remain. Major agriculture production zone shows better carbon efficiency than key ecological function zone, but lower than key economic development zone. It is also found carbon abatement cost of major agriculture production zone is lower than key economic development zone indicating the less pressure under climate change mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions efficiency; Major agriculture production zone; Marginal abatement cost; Poyang lake eco-economic zone","Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Efficiency; Lakes; Planning; Agriculture productions; Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Directional distance function; Ecological function zones; Empirical investigation; Marginal abatement costs; Poyang lake eco-economic zones; Climate change; abatement cost; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; economic development; environmental economics; national strategy; sustainable development; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake","Li, Y.; School of International Development, United Kingdom; email: y.li4@uea.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

This not only helps the economy grow faster, resulting in a higher standard of living, but also reduces the amount of energy consumed and carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of output. This suggests that previous studies could be underestimating the social benefits of carbon prices and their role in effectively limiting the emissions of greenhouse gases that cause climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Carbon policy has the capacity to influence the direction of innovation in the energy system. Here we provide evidence that when the energy costs comprise a higher fraction of the costs of production, a carbon tax or other equivalent policy (e.g., renewable portfolio standards) creates incentives such that the economy will choose technologies that use energy more efficiently. Higher energy prices, induced by policy decisions, lead to improved energy-use efficiency via this mechanism. The induced efficiency improvements not only help the economy grow more rapidly, delivering a higher standard of living than would otherwise be predicted, but also reduce the amount of energy consumed and carbon dioxide emitted per dollar of output. This suggests that previous studies have been insufficiently optimistic about what carbon prices could do for the economy and how much carbon prices would reduce the amount of energy and emissions per dollar of economic activity. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.Induced energy-saving efficiency improvements strongly influence energy use and climate change. This mechanism has previously been studied by bottom-up methods in models, but the effect is debatable because of lack of empirical data needed to calibrate model parameters. We provide a top-down calibration of the relation between historical rates of various efficiency changes and energy's share of costs. To do this, we develop a modification of Solow's model of economic productivity. We find that a 1% rise in energy cost share increases energy-use efficiency by about 1.2% in the following 20 years, a higher gain compared to previous bottom-up estimates. When we incorporate this relationship into an integrated assessment model, we find that carbon prices save up to 30% more energy by 2120, relative to model configurations without the inducing mechanism. A carbon tax induces energy-saving efficiency improvements and could therefore be a more effective mitigation tool than previously recognized. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","carbon price; climate change; economic growth; energy consumption; energy cost share; energy trend; energy-saving efficiency improvements; energy-use efficiency; induced technological change; integrated assessment model","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Carbon price; Economic growths; Efficiency improvement; Energy cost; Energy trends; Energy-use efficiency; Induced technological change; Integrated assessment models; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; climate change; cost analysis; economic growth; emission control; energy conservation; energy efficiency; energy use; integrated approach; pollution tax; technological change","Wang, R.; Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, China; email: rongwang@fudan.edu.cn",,"Cell Press",25424351,,,,"English","Joule",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071686339

However, their dependence on meagre incomes from nontimber forest products (NTFPs) and payment for ecosystem services (PES) are leading to continuing poverty. It is doubtful if the program, Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) has yet achieved much in its primary goal of forest conservation, and the chance of it helping to alleviate rural poverty is slim. Forest conservation per se hardly creates economic opportunities, beyond survival, for rural people. Our efforts for conserving forests and their biodiversity will remain less effective as long as there are so many enclaves of trenchant poverty within and around them in the landscapes and we continue to by-pass practical routes to poverty alleviation. Poverty can be alleviated only if local actions spur economic development in which local communities have a rightful and fair share and can earn rewards for their entrepreneurships. Wood is a renewable, recyclable, versatile and sustainable natural resource. The demands for wood products are rising in developing countries, as their economies grow. They also face endemic wood deficits. This provides opportunities to pro-actively develop commercial forestry as a path to rural development and poverty alleviation. That would also assist national climate change mitigation measures, because forests sequester carbon, wood products are largely carbon positive and timber- based options are on hand to substitute for high emission materials such as concrete, steel and aluminium used to build our living environments. To move along this path, the businesses of tree growing by small-growers and local value adding should be strengthened, catalysing the entrepreneurial spirits of local people. Central to this is the need to put in place strategies to improve the productivity of and value from small scale enterprises; yet there is a serious lack of research and application to serve this key need. Among other constraints faced by small-growers include, lack of transparent and legal rights to land ownership in several countries, layers of bureaucratic regulations and the current international forest certification systems which are cumbersome and unaffordable for small-growers. Actions are possible and needed for simplifying or removing road blocks on all these fronts, along with, importantly, the development of markets for diverse products. Growth of the forestry sector as an engine for rural development warrants far greater recognition and investment than has been the case so far. We need to re-imagine and strengthen the role of forestry including commercial wood business - green growth - as an effective path to rural development and poverty alleviation. © 2019","Climate change mitigation; Environmental incomes; Forestry; Poverty alleviation; Rural economy; Small-growers; Wood products","Biodiversity; Carbon; Concrete products; Conservation; Deforestation; Developing countries; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Laws and legislation; Regional planning; Timber; Tropics; Wood products; Climate change mitigation; Environmental incomes; Poverty alleviation; Rural economy; Small-growers; Climate change; biodiversity; climate change; ecological economics; economic development; ecosystem service; environmental economics; forest management; forestry; green economy; landownership; market conditions; nontimber forest product; poverty alleviation; rural development; rural economy; tropical forest; wood; Biodiversity; Carbon; Concrete; Conservation; Deforestation; Developing Countries","Nambiar, E.K.S.; CSIRO Land and Water, GPO Box 1700, Australia; email: Sadu.Nambiar@csiro.au",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

Energy performance certificates (EPCs) were implemented as one of the tools to promote this agenda, and are used for the energy performance assessment of buildings. In this study, the characteristics of the Portuguese dwelling stock are regionally analysed using data from approximately 523,000 Portuguese residential EPCs. Furthermore, a bottom-up building typology approach is used to assess the regional energy needs impact of retrofitting actions and to estimate the heating and cooling energy performance gaps of the whole dwelling stock, as well as the potential CO2 emissions resulting from the gaps' potential offset due to increase thermal comfort. The results show that Portuguese residential buildings have very low energy performance, with windows and roofs being identified as the most energy inefficient elements. Roof retrofitting has the highest potential for the reduction of energy needs. The estimated heating and cooling energy performance gap amount to very significant percentages, due to the poor performing building stock but also very low energy consumption levels, with probable consequences for the thermal comfort of occupants. Assuming the current energy mix, carbon emissions would be 9.8 and 20.2 times higher associated with heating and cooling, respectively, if the actual final energy consumption were to match the estimated theoretical values derived from building regulation. This study demonstrates several application cases and leverages the potential of the individual EPC, increasing the detail in the dwelling stock characterization and energy performance estimation, revealing its value for energy retrofit and climate change mitigation assessments, as well as establishing the ground for future work related to building retrofits, energy efficiency measure implementation, climate change mitigation, thermal comfort, and energy poverty studies. © 2019 The Author(s).

The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) was used to project this impact on streamflow and sediment yield until year 2050 by applying five climate models for scenario A1B involving medium emissions. The models were calibrated and validated based on daily observed streamflow and sediment recorded for the periods from 1984 to 2013 and 1984 to 1985, respectively. The Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency and coefficient of determination values for the calibration (validation) were 0.61 (0.53) and 0.6 (0.62) for Derbendkhan and Hemrin, respectively. In addition, the average of the future predictions for the five climate models indicated that the streamflow (sediment yield) for the Derbendkhan and HemrinWatersheds would decrease to 49% (43.7%) and 20% (30%), respectively, until 2050, compared with the observed flow of the base period from 1984 to 2013. The spatial analysis showed that 10.4% and 68% of the streamflow comes from Iraqi parts of the Derbendkhan and Hemrin Watersheds, respectively, while 10% and 60% of the sediment comes from the Iraqi parts of the Derbendkhan and Hemrin Watersheds, respectively. Deforestation of the northern part of the Hemrin Watershed is the best method to decrease the amount of sediment entering the Hemrin Reservoir. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Diyala River; SWAT model",,"Al-Khafaji, M.S.; Civil Engineering Department, Iraq; email: 41100@uotechnology.edu.iq",,"MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute",23065338,,,,"English","Hydrology",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077140916

This paper develops a reflection on the possible contributions of water-related building installations to mitigate emissions and increase urban area adaptation to the effects of climate change. One of the most promising solutions to facing climate change, which is analysed in detail in this paper, is combining rainwater harvesting systems with green roofs. However, in view of developing the necessary engineering projects, there are insufficient existing studies to estimate the parameters to be used in each location given their climate characteristics, particularly the monthly runoff coefficients, which constitute the key parameter for designing these installations in some regions. Some recent standards present generic theoretical values for designing these combined installations, but they are far from reality in some regions, such as the Mediterranean basin. Therefore, based on the data available in Portugal, this paper reports some of the results obtained from research on the values of the monthly runoff coefficients. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation and resilience; Climate change; Green roofs; Water efficiency in buildings",,"Pimentel-Rodrigues, C.; ANQIP (Portugal) and University of Aveiro/RISCO (Portugal)Portugal; email: anqip@anqip.pt",,"MDPI AG",20763417,,,,"English","Appl.

This topic has been taken up equally by professionals as well as the general public. Adaptation and mitigation actions are needed, especially in cities where the concentration of population and an increased demand for resources (e.g., water, food, land) are expected in the coming years. Already, 400 cities have been declared to be in a ""climate emergency"" state. There are no longer any doubts that current environmental state requires actions and solutions for both the alarming climate situation and urban quality life development. If such action is not going to be taken, the environmental state will deteriorate. One possible solution could be the use of green infrastructure. This research compares approaches to green areas and green infrastructure development in Bratislava (Slovakia) and Wrocław (Poland). A comparison was made for projects realized between 2013 and 2018-i.e., since the publication of the European Union (EU) Strategy on Adaptation to Climate Change in 2013. The research presents an overview of delivered projects regarding land use. The overview, which is supported by a density map of implemented green projects, verifies whether the new greenery fits and fills in the existing natural areas. Secondly, the green projects were analyzed according to years and land use types using Tableau software. Moreover, the legislation of climate adaptation mechanisms and practical aspects of green infrastructure implementation are shown. Finally, actions concerning the greening of the cities were categorized into practical, educational, and participatory ones, and the potential of green infrastructure as a positive landscape, micro-climate, health, and aesthetic influence was examined. © 2019 by the authors.","Cities; Climate adaptation; Climate change; Climate emergency; Green infrastructure; Sustainability","Land use; Sustainable development; Adaptation mechanism; Adaptation to climate changes; Cities; Climate adaptation; Climate change adaptation; Climate emergency; Environmental state; Green infrastructure; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; greenspace; mitigation; quality of life; sustainability; urban development; Bratislava; Bratislavsky; Dolnoslaskie; Poland [Central Europe]; Slovakia; Wroclaw [Dolnoslaskie]","Belčáková, I.; UNESCO Department for Ecological Awareness and Sustainable Development, Slovakia; email: belcakova@tuzvo.sk",,"MDPI AG",20734433,,,,"English","Atmosphere",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072253260

Across the world, production of cement is the most energy and emission intensive industry hence, the cement industry is currently under pressure to reduce greenhouse gases emissions (GHGEs). However, reducing the GHGEs of the cement industry especially for developing country like India is not an easy task. Cement manufacturing industry needs to focus on significant climate change mitigation strategies to reduce the GHGEs to sustain its production. This study aims at identifying significant climate change mitigation strategies of the cement manufacturing industry in the context of India. Extant literature review and expert opinion are used to identify climate change mitigation strategies of the cement manufacturing industry. In the present study, a model projects by applying both AHP and DEMATEL techniques to assess the climate change mitigation strategies of the cement industry. The AHP technique help in establishing the priorities of climate change mitigation strategies, while the DEMATEL technique forms the causal relationships among them. Through AHP, the results of this research demonstrate that Fuel emission reduction is on top most priority while the relative importance priority of the main remaining factors is Process emission reduction - Electric energy-related emission - Emission avoidance and reduction - Management mitigation measures. The findings also indicate that the main factors, Process emission reduction, and Fuel emission reduction are categorized in cause group factors, while the remaining factors, Electric energy-related emission, Emission avoidance and reduction and Management mitigation measures are in effect group factors.

A number of approaches have been suggested, but the community appears to be silent on the potential of one of the most revolutionary technologies of the current century, systems and synthetic biology (SSB). The potential of SSB to modulate the fast carbon cycle, and thereby mitigate climate change is in itself enormous, but if the history of genomics is any measure, it is also reasonable to expect sizeable economic returns on any investment. More generally, the approach to climate control has been badly unbalanced. The last three decades have seen intense international attention to emission control, with no parallel plan to test, scale and implement carbon removal technologies, including attention to their economic, legal and ethical implications.

In recent years, the relationship between health and the environment has become particularly pronounced, with the impacts of climate change identified as having the potential to reverse the last 50 years of public health advancement (Watts et al., 2015). Increasingly, professional bodies within health care are called upon to frame climate change as a health issue. Despite this, studies have found that nurses report feeling ill-equipped to respond to environmental changes and the resulting health impacts (Anåker, Nilsson, Holmner, & Elf, 2015; Lewis, 2018; Polivka, Chaudry, & Mac Crawford, 2011). This article recognizes some of the barriers facing concerned health-care professionals who wish to introduce climate mitigation activities within their sphere of professional operation. The Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (Victorian Branch) was approached by nurses, midwives, and carers, to become more involved in policy debates surrounding climate change and to provide stronger support to members in responding to environmental issues. The result is top-down and bottom-up responses working in synergy for climate change mitigation, by empowering nurses to make changes to their professional practice. © Copyright 2019 Creative Health Care Management.","call to action; climate change mitigation; environment; impacts of climate change; nursing practice; public health","article; climate change; environmental change; human; midwife; nursing practice; professional practice; Australia; health care policy; nurse attitude; nursing organization; Australia; Climate Change; Health Policy; Humans; Nurse's Role; Societies, Nursing","Morgan, R.E.; Victorian Branch of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery FederationAustralia; email: rmorgan@anmfvic.asn.au",,"Springer Publishing Company",10784535,,,"31427414","English","Creat.

The evolution of extreme heat risk in cities depends on the interactions of large-scale climate change with regional dynamics and urban micro-climates as well as the distribution and demographic characteristics of people who live and work within these micro-climate areas. Here we use California as a testbed where we employ a suite of high-resolution (1.5 km) future regional climate simulations coupled with a satellite-driven urban canopy model and a spatially explicit population projection to investigate the interacting effects of climate change, population growth, and urban heat mitigation measures, such as cool roofs, on exposure to extreme heat events. We find that climate change and population growth reinforce with one another to drive substantial increases in future exposure to heat extremes, which are poised to become more frequent, longer, and more intense. Exposure to events analogous to historic high-mortality extreme heat waves increases by 3.5-6 folds. Widespread implementation of cool roofs can offset a substantial fraction (51%-100%) of the increased heat exposure and associated building energy demand owing to climate change in urbanized regions. © US Government - Department of Energy.","climate change; extreme heat exposure; population growth; urban climate adaptation","Climate models; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Roofs; Urban growth; Building energy demands; Demographic characteristics; Heat exposure; Mitigation measures; Population growth; Regional climate simulation; Urban canopy models; Urban climates; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; extreme event; microclimate; nature-society relations; population dynamics; population growth; regional climate; urban climate; urbanization",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17489318,,,,"English","Environ.Res.Lett.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072729945

This paper introduces experience and modality of Japan's fluorocarbon control policy, particularly of the latest revision enforced by Act on Rational Use and Proper Management of Fluorocarbon. The act obliges owners of air conditioning/refrigeration units (here in after ""equipment"") deal with fluorinated gases emissions both in usage phase and in decommissioning phase. This paper explains modality of the provisions stipulated in the act focusing on stakeholders of building, with explanation of supplemental efforts made voluntarily. It is explained that supplemental measures are vital in addition to the obligation, for the sake of ensuring the fluorocarbon emissions reduction measures completed. Besides, this paper explains in regard to expected greenhouse gases reduction by refrigerant leakage prevention in usage phase. Under Japan's fluorinated gases control policy, owners of equipment must conduct inspection of each unit once a designated period to prevent leakage of fluorinated gases, as well as calculating and reporting seepage emissions of fluorinated gases used for refrigerant to government if it is more than a threshold. This obligation makes owners of equipment conscious of leakage emissions of fluorinated gases used for refrigerant, which result in leakage prevention. As effects of leakage prevention of fluorinated gases in building sector in Japan, both the estimated significance of emission reduction in retailing sector and results of the policy implementation in building sector are shown. Japan's fluorocarbon emission control policy has been characteristic in world. Sharing the experience could contribute to setting up further HFCs emissions reduction measures, especially in Asia region where emissions of fluorinated gases used for refrigerant are expected to increase. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air conditioning; Buildings; Emission control; Fluorocarbons; Greenhouse gases; Refrigerants; Sustainable development; Climate change mitigation; Effects of leakage; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Leakage prevention; Policy implementations; Refrigerant leakages; Retailing sector; Climate change",,,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

There is, however, a great diversity in how these evaluative responses have been defined, operationalized, and measured across studies. In order to shed some light on this subject, we reviewed 118 studies published over the last 15 years aiming at measurement of policy acceptability, acceptance, support, and other responses to climate change mitigation policies. We found that conceptual vagueness and weak theoretical embedding are pervasive in the field, which leads to uncertainty over what is being measured, ambiguity of policy recommendations, and difficulties in comparing empirical results. In response, we propose a construct of policy attitudes as an overarching concept comprising the diversity of measures and constructs already in use. The purpose of the construct is to serve as a common basis for operationalization and survey design. In order to inform policy makers, researchers should be clear in how they formulate surveys with a focus on questions of importance to research and policy-making. Key policy insightsAcceptability, acceptance, and support are defined as distinct and possibly empirically distinguishable classes of responses evaluating a policy proposal. These responses are expressions of underlying policy attitudes. People may respond to policies in other ways as well, including lack of interest. There is no popularity threshold for a policy to be safe to implement, but instead it is a matter of identifying the conditions of policy support or other responses. Results obtained using different measures of mitigation policy attitudes vary widely with respect to the characteristics of the policy in question and the measured response. Thus, great care must be taken when designing surveys and interpreting their results. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change mitigation; policy acceptance; policy attitudes; policy support; Public acceptability","climate change; environmental policy; mitigation; policy making; public attitude","Kyselá, E.; Charles University, Eva Kyselá, Jan Palach square 2, Czech Republic; email: eva.kysela@ff.cuni.cz",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

Climate change mitigation policies play a central role in this process. To maximize the benefits and minimize the negative effects of climate change mitigation policies, policymakers need to be aware of the indirect and often complex social and inequality impacts that these policies may have and the pathways through which these impacts emerge. Better understanding of the distributional and inequality impacts is important to avoid negative social and distributional outcomes as countries ratchet up their climate policy ambition in the post-Paris context. This paper synthesizes evidence from the existing literature on social co-impacts of climate change mitigation policy and their implications for inequality. The analysis shows that most policies are linked to both co-benefits and adverse side-effects, and can compound or lessen inequalities depending on contextual factors, policy design and policy implementation. The risk of negative outcomes is greater in contexts characterized by high levels of poverty, corruption and economic and social inequalities, and where limited action is taken to identify and mitigate potentially adverse side-effects. Key policy insights The risk of adverse social outcomes associated with climate change mitigation policies, including worsening inequality, increases as countries ratchet up their ambition to meet the Paris Agreement targets. Many policies that have so far only been piloted will need to be up-scaled. Negative inequality impacts of climate policies can be mitigated (and possibly even prevented), but this requires conscious effort, careful planning and multi-stakeholder engagement. Best results can be achieved when potential inequality impacts are taken into consideration in all stages of policy making, including policy planning, development and implementation. Climate change mitigation policies should take a pro-poor approach that, in best case scenarios, can also lead to a reduction of existing inequalities. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

A large share of global non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is attributed to agriculture, with a significant contribution related to dairy production. As demonstrated by the results of a recent USDA coordinated project, Dairy-CAP, dairy farmers can significantly reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by implementing beneficial management practices (BMPs). This study assesses the potential mitigation of projected climate change if greenhouse gases associated with the dairy subsector were reduced. To compare the performance of several mitigation measures under future climate change, we employ a fully coupled Earth system model of intermediate complexity, the MIT Earth System Model. With an interactive carbon-cycle, the model is capable of addressing important feedbacks between the climate and terrestrial biosphere impacting greenhouse gas concentrations. We illustrate the importance of ongoing mitigation efforts in the agricultural sector to reduce non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions towards established climate goals. If BMPs are implemented globally within the next three decades, projected warming by the end of the century can be reduced by 0.21 C on average or 6% of total warming, with dairy farm mitigation contributing to 0.03 C of the temperature reduction. © 2019 The Author(s).

Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent of how the cities or local governments can cope with the challenges of the current transport sector climate change mitigation in Bandung City. This paper aims to assess the governance context of climate policies in Bandung City and support further co-benefits. The preliminary stage of study shows that the policies in reducing GHG emissions are not in accordance with what was written by the government. The provincial and local government was aware that the stipulation delivered by the central government regarding mitigation on climate change stated in the regulation both in provincial and local level. Based on the actor's characteristic, the policies that encourage to reduce GHG emissions drive as a multi-actor interaction process namely The Paratransit, Trans Metro Bandung (TMB) and Vehicle Emissions Test. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City, Indonesia. The analytical framework used for this analysis is the Governance Assessment Tool and the co-benefits approach. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, and secondary quantitative data. The results reveal that the governance qualities create a context that there still are some limits, although several improvements have shown the positive trend at the local level. This is due to the qualities of the extent aspect as a low to moderate, the flexibility as a restrictive, and the coherence and intensity as moderate. The assessment of the criteria of co-benefits is more relevant to the public transport. The TMB has met all of the criteria of co-benefits. Thus, this TMB program has the highest impact to attain the co-benefits. The paratransit has the positive value of the criteria for lowering GHG emissions, energy and environmental sustainability, and development goals. The vehicle emission test met the criteria of sustainability and technical feasibility. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Developing countries; Digital storage; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Sustainable development; Central government; Climate change mitigation; Empirical case studies; Environmental sustainability; Interaction process; Semi structured interviews; Transport sectors; Vehicle emission test; Climate change","Gunawan, H.; Department of Governance and Technology of Sustainability (CSTM), Netherlands; email: h.gunawan@utwente.nl","ParikesitSunardiJaegler A.Franco-Garcia L.Withaningsih S.Utama G.L.Supyandi D.Malik A.D.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

One strand of literature demonstrates that compact cities of sufficient density result in lower GHG emissions in the transport and the buildings sectors compared to sprawled cities. Another strand of literature, however, reveals that compactness hinders climate adaptation by amplifying the urban heat island (UHI) effect. As a result, mitigation and adaptation objectives of cities appear to contradict each other. Here, we develop a geometrical optimization framework and model of a three-dimensional city that minimizes this conflict. It makes use of the observation that low-carbon efficient transport can be realized via linear public transport axes, and that GHG emissions and UHI effects scale differently with varying geometric properties, thus enabling design that reflects both the economics and the climate of cities. We find that star-shaped cities, in contrast to radially symmetric cities, are well suited to alleviate the problematic trade-off. We also demonstrate that urban design considerations depend on transport fuel prices. The results are of particular importance for city planners of rapidly urbanizing cities in Asia and Africa who still have the potential to shape urban layout. © 2019 The Author(s).

The novelty of this study is grounded predominantly in evaluating for the first time the response of annual GHG fluxes to thinning in a coniferous peri-urban forest soil in Greece, thus contributing significantly to the enrichment of the GHG fluxes database from the Mediterranean forest ecosystem. Results suggest that CH4 uptake increased with increasing thinning intensity. The reduction in CO2 emissions in both thinning treatments was possibly related to an indirect effect of soil heterotrophic and autotrophic respiration. Coniferous peri-urban forests in Greece can act temporally as sinks of atmospheric N2O in the coldest months and a weak source of N2O fluxes in summer. The GHG variation depended largely on soil environmental factors with soil temperature representing the dominant factor for CO2 and CH4, whereas soil moisture correlated, albeit weakly, with N2O variability. Reduction in global warming potential was observed in both thinning treatments, markedly in selective treatment, giving an initial indication that high-intensity thinning in coniferous peri-urban forests in Greece presents a high potential for global change mitigation. © 2019 Society of American Foresters.","Climate-change mitigation; Global-warming potential; Greenhouse gases; Thinning treatments","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Global warming; Knowledge management; Soil moisture; Atmospheric greenhouse; Autotrophic respiration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental factors; Global warming potential; Mediterranean forest ecosystems; Mediterranean region; Thinning treatment; Greenhouse gases; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greece; Greenhouse Gases; Mediterranean",,,"Oxford University Press",0015749X,,FOSCA,,"English","For.

This research was conducted to assess the impact of area exclusion on carbon sequestration potential in the two land use systems: protected natural vegetation (PNV) and communal grazing land (CGL). Data of vegetation, litter, and soils were collected using systematic sampling methods, laying 19 transects and 62 quadrats each with 20 m × 20 m for trees, 5 m × 5 m sub-quadrats for shrubs, and 1 m × 1m sub-quadrats for herbs/grasses, litter biomass, and soil sample. Aboveground biomass carbon (AGC), belowground biomass carbon (BGC), soil organic carbon (SOC), and total carbon stock (TC) were estimated using allometric equations. The mean difference level of carbon stocks (P < 0.05) of the two land use systems was tested through unequal variance t-test using R-software. The mean above ground and below ground carbon stock of PNV, 21.05 ton/ha, 10.39 ton/ha, was higher than CGL, 15.31 ton/ha, 7.65 ton/ha, respectively. The average values of SOC was 16.60 ton/ha from PNV and 13.76 ton/ha from CGL. The mean value of SOC was higher at the PNV than CGL and significantly different (P < 0.05). The total carbon stock estimate of PNV and CGL were 50.74 ton/ha and 37.11 ton/ha, respectively, which is significantly different (P < 0.05). We concluded that, establishment of PNV as the best practice of restoration programs through exclusion of livestock from free grazing and human interference provides cost effective mechanism that yields a high carbon sequestration potential with multiple benefits for biodiversity conservation, livelihood support, and climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Author(s)","Agricultural science; Ecology; Environmental science; Plant biology",,"Atsbha, T.; Tigray Agricultural Research Institute, P.O.

Nevertheless, their current CS potential is declining due to human disturbance, with further decrease expected under global population growth and climate change scenarios. Literature has documented various measures that seek to enhance CS by wetlands and therefore enable these ecosystems remain vital in global carbon (C) balance and climate change mitigation. The objective of this review is to critically analyse these measures with respect to their feasibility and impact on wetland functioning, both in ecological and socio-economic perspectives. In doing this, we strive to address the concerns of wetland scientists, managers and other stakeholders pertaining CS by wetlands. Findings indicate that CS can be enhanced through both non-manipulative and manipulative measures. Non-manipulative measures aim at enhancing CS by increasing wetlands’ spatial extent, while manipulative ones aim at altering characteristics of certain wetland components that influence CS. Their overall target is to increase organic matter input, apportion C to longer-lived pools, and increase residence times of C pools. Based on the identified research gaps, we recommend that CS actions for wetlands should prioritize conservation of existing natural wetlands. Additional measures should consider associated risks such as those on wetland flora and fauna, soil and hydrological regimes, and competing services. We further believe that successful implementation of non-manipulative measures for CS will require attachment of economic incentives that are not only foreseeable, but also adequate to match returns from competing land uses. © 2019, King Abdulaziz University and Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Wetlands","carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; literature review; methane; socioeconomic impact; wetland","Were, D.; Department of Environmental Management, P.O.

The purchased permits were then withdrawn from the ETS. Here, individual behavior is controlled by means of the strategy method. In this study, we observed different types of behavior, including conditionally cooperative behavior. Overall, the probability of contributing to CO2 emissions reduction is higher if the subjects considering contributing to CO2 emissions reduction can assume that a two-thirds majority of all the other subjects are also willing to do so, compared to a situation where only up to one-third of all the other participants decide to contribute to this scheme. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","CO2 emissions; Conditional cooperation; Emissions trading scheme; ETS; Permits",,"Pei, J.; School of International Trade and Economics, 10 Huixin Dongjie, China; email: jpei@uibe.edu.cn",,"Elsevier B.V.",1043951X,,,,"English","China Econ.

These products can substitute for energy-intensive products made of conventional materials. The main objective of this study was to quantify substitution benefits of wood furniture for China via national-scale mitigation analyses. We selected a basket of representative furniture and estimated the emission reduction for two functionally equivalent products, which differentiate in wood intensity. The emissions avoided in each type of product were weighted by its share of the furniture market to ensure that the basket can represent the current situation. Then, avoided emissions were estimated for wood commodities contained in the products basket. Results demonstrated that wood materials exerted low environmental impacts. From the less to the more wood intensity products with the equivalent function, the proportion of energy-intensive materials decreased 24% while the proportion of their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions decreased 34%. The overall displacement factor for the wood material was 2.67 kg CO2eq/kg or 1.46 tC/tC. The findings highlight the importance of material selection in mitigating climate change in the furniture sector. It is urgent to use of the existing timber resources efficiently and pursue alternative schemes for emission reduction to achieve the goal of GHG mitigation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Furniture sector; Wood materials; Wood substitution effect","Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Wood; Climate change mitigation; Conventional materials; Equivalent functions; Furniture sector; Proportion of energy; Substitution effect; Wood materials; Wood-based products; Climate change; climate change; emission control; environmental impact; greenhouse gas; mitigation; national planning; quantitative analysis; wood; China","Yang, H.; College of Economics and Management, No. 159, Longpan Road, China; email: yhqnfu@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

This study aims at assessing the development of climate change mitigation and adaptation planning in Italian cities. To this end, we analysed the availability of Local Climate Plans (LCPs) in 76 cities, which are included in the Eurostat Urban Audit (UA-2015) database. In a further step, we analysed the content of the urban climate change mitigation and adaptation plans available in a smaller sample of 32 Italian cities of 2007 Eurostat Urban Audit database (UA-3), looking at the single actions undertaken for addressing mitigation and adaptation to climate change. Results show the almost total absence of comprehensive and stand-alone urban climate change adaptation plans in Italy (except for two cities, Ancona and Bologna), whereas we found that in 61 out of 76 cities municipal civil protection plans are the instruments that deal with local emergencies associated to extreme weather events. On the other hand, 56 out of 76 urban climate change mitigation plans (i.e. Sustainable Energy Action Plans) are being developed in the framework of the Covenant of Mayors, which is a transnational network of local governments created by the European Union (EU) in 2012. The results obtained on the mitigation side point out that, in absence of a national law that imposes Italian cities to develop LCPs, transnational networks are an effective boost to voluntary commitment to reach EU climate and energy objectives. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"adaptive management; climate change; environmental planning; European Union; local government; mitigation; urban climate; urban planning; Italy; Leptospira","Pietrapertosa, F.; Institute of Methodologies for Environmental Analysis (IMAA), C. da S.

For this purpose, we quantify mitigation efforts in terms of emission reductions and mitigation costs for a number of major world regions, considering scenarios with and without climate finance. The influence of socio-economic drivers on the burden sharing is crucial, but it has not yet been studied in the context of the most recent scenario framework—the shared socio-economic pathway scenarios (SSPs). Here, we show that sustainable development as represented by the SSP1 scenario reduces the challenges of burden sharing and makes it easier to achieve equitable climate policies. In contrast, in a scenario with fossil-fueled development (SSP5), the risk of political infeasibility—measured by the variation of mitigation costs across regions and the amount of implied international transfers—increases with most burden-sharing regimes. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate change; Emission control; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Climate stabilization; Emission reduction; Mitigation costs; Socio-economics; Economic and social effects; climate change; cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development","Leimbach, M.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), 60 12 03, Germany; email: leimbach@pik-potsdam.de",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

The mental health literature broadly characterises negative emotional reactions to extreme weather experiences as undesirable impacts on wellbeing. Yet, other research in psychology suggests that negative emotional responses to extreme weather are an important motivation for personal action on climate change. This article addresses the intersection of mental health and functional perspectives on negative emotions, with a specific focus on the potential that reduced negative emotional responses to extreme weather may also translate to diminished motivation to undertake climate change mitigation actions–which we term the ‘resilience paradox’. Using survey data gathered in the aftermath of severe flooding across the UK in winter 2013/2014, we present new evidence indicating that self-appraised coping ability moderates the link between flooding experience and negative emotions and thereby attenuates the indirect link between flooding experience and climate change mitigation intentions. We conclude that support for flood victims should extend beyond addressing emotional, physical and financial stresses to include acknowledgement of the involvement of climate change and communication of the need for action to combat future climate risks. Key policy insights Psychological resilience to flooding and other extreme weather events can translate to diminished motivation to mitigate climate change Negative emotional reactions need to occur at an optimal level to enable people to respond appropriately to climate risks. Flood victims’ subjective appraisal of their ability to cope does not necessarily encompass consideration of the role played by climate change. Therefore, support for victims of extreme weather should include explicit acknowledgement of the involvement of climate change and the need for action to mitigate future climate risks. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

On the one hand, concerns about food security highlight the need to prioritize adaptation; on the other hand, the target of the Paris Agreement (keeping global temperature rise well below 2°C) cannot be achieved without a significant decrease in agricultural emissions. Various analyses of nationally determined contributions (NDCs) submitted under the Paris Agreement show how countries intend to prioritize the needs for adaptation and mitigation in the agricultural sector. This paper focuses on 46 countries that contribute 90% of global agricultural emissions and asks how they are addressing the agricultural sector in their climate mitigation policies. It takes into account that conditions and circumstances in countries vary significantly but might also indicate similar patterns. The analysis is based on information provided by countries in their NDCs, as well as their Biennial Reports (BRs) or Biennial Update Reports (BURs) under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It further includes data on national agricultural emissions. By applying a mixed methods approach, which combines qualitative content analysis and comparative cluster analysis, we find that countries vary in their progress on agriculture and climate mitigation for many different reasons. These reasons include the national perception of the problem, divergent starting points for climate policy, particularities of the agricultural sector and, correspondingly, the availability of cost-effective mitigation technologies. Key policy insights While for many countries the NDCs signify the beginning of their climate policy, UNFCCC biennial reports can be used to learn more about the policies that countries have already implemented. Mitigation action in the agricultural sector is emphasized most prominently in cases where co-benefits are possible and production is not impacted negatively. Policies and measures in the agricultural sector often do not align with the UNFCCC system of monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV). In addition to improving MRV-systems, it seems equally important to exchange national experiences with implemented measures and policies. The Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture could take into account the problem of different definitions of sector boundaries and thus the importance of different mitigation measures. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",,"adaptive management; agricultural emission; climate change; environmental legislation; environmental policy; food security; policy implementation; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","Hönle, S.E.; Thünen-Institute, Bundesallee 64, Germany; email: susanna.hoenle@thuenen.de",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

The study was based on the comparison of different strategies applied to a balsam fir-white birch stand in the Eastern boreal forest of Quebec (Canada). Five scenarios were simulated over a 199-year period at the stand level: A reference scenario involving clearcut at 50-year intervals, and four alternative scenarios clearcut with longer rotation length (70 and 80 years), partial cut, and a no harvest scenario. The study included an appropriate sensitivity analysis of the results. Overall, scenarios with longer clearcut rotations and, to a lesser extent, partial cut resulted in a higher potential to mitigate climate change.

Benefits of climatechange mitigation for reducing the impacts of sea-level rise in G-20 countries. Journal of Coastal Research, 35(4), 884-895. Coconut Creek (Florida), ISSN 0749-0208. This paper assesses the potential benefits of climate-change mitigation in reducing the impacts of sea-level rise over the 21st century in G-20 countries (excluding the European Union as a whole), using the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment model. Impacts of the expected number of people flooded annually and wetland losses were assessed. To assess the benefits of mitigation, it was assumed that defences were not upgraded during the study. Globally, with a sea-level rise of 0.68 m by the 2080s (with respect to 1980-99), representing a potential future with limited climate-change mitigation, and with the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios A1 socio-economic scenario, 123 million additional people could be flooded annually and 39% of present global wetland stock could be lost. For a 0.19-m rise in sea level, associated with a substantial reduction in emissions, the number of people flooded could be reduced to 13 million/y, with 21% of global wetland stock loss, unless new wetlands emerge. Collectively, non-Annex 1 G-20 countries experience a disproportionately higher number of people flooded in their nations compared with the proportion of population flooded globally. The greatest wetland losses for G-20 countries are projected for Australia, Indonesia, and the United States. Thus, G-20 nations with the highest emissions or gross domestic product frequently do not experience the greatest impacts, despite some of these nations being potentially more able to pay for adaptation. © 2019 Coastal Education and Research Foundation, Inc.","Adaptation; equity; expected number of people at risk from flooding; wetland loss","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; coastal protection; equity; European Union; flooding; G-20 country; risk assessment; sea level change; wetland management; Australia; Florida [United States]; Indonesia; United States","Brown, S.; Faculty of Physical Sciences and Engineering, United Kingdom; email: sb20@soton.ac.uk",,"Coastal Education Research Foundation Inc.",07490208,,JCRSE,,"English","J.

On the one hand, SAVs could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by driving more efficiently, avoiding traffic congestion, accelerating adoption of alternative fuel vehicles, and charging in alignment with renewable electricity generation. On the other hand, SAVs could induce more vehicle miles traveled (VMT) by lowering the time cost of travel and allowing non-drivers to travel more by car. In this study, we develop an energy system optimization model that integrates the electricity and transport sectors, computes endogenous technology adoption, and distinguishes SAVs from privately owned vehicles (POVs) to explore the contributions of SAVs to climate change mitigation. Our results show that widespread SAV adoption lowers costs and emissions, and that these desirable outcomes remain true even if SAVs induce double the VMT of the POVs they replace. SAVs dramatically accelerate the market penetration of electric vehicles. The environmental and economic benefits of this electrification trend are larger if electric SAV charging can be optimally aligned with renewable electricity generation. Especially in the short to medium term, SAV adoption can be a more impactful lever than a carbon tax for decarbonizing vehicle travel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Autonomous vehicles; Climate change mitigation; Decarbonization; Electric vehicles; Energy system modeling; Ridesharing","Autonomous vehicles; Climate models; Decarbonization; Electric automobiles; Electric power generation; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Traffic congestion; Alternative fuel vehicles; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Energy system model; Energy system optimizations; Renewable electricity; Ride-sharing; Vehicle-miles traveled; Climate change; climate change; electric vehicle; electrification; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; optimization; pollution tax; technology adoption; travel time","Leibowicz, B.D.; Operations Research and Industrial Engineering, ETC 5.128D, 204 E.

In previous research, assessing the influence of information on health effects on people's motivation to adopt mitigation actions, health co-benefits for the individual were typically confounded with collective health co-benefits, for example from pollution reduction. The present research aims to overcome this limitation by providing information on individual health co-benefits that are unconditional on the actions of others (direct health co-benefits). We report effects of this kind of health information on stated willingness to adopt mitigation actions as well as on simulation-based carbon emission reductions in a pre-registered experimental setting among 308 households in 4 mid-size case-study cities in 4 European high-income countries: France, Germany, Norway and Sweden. For each mitigation action from the sectors food, housing, and mobility, half of the sample received the amount of CO2equivalents (CO2-eq) saved and the financial costs or savings the respective action generated. The other half additionally received information on direct health co-benefits, where applicable. For households receiving information on direct health co-benefits, we find a higher mean willingness to adopt food and housing actions, and a greater proportion very willing to adopt one or more mitigation actions (OR 1.86, 95% CI 1.1, 3.12); and a greater simulated reduction in overall carbon footprint: difference in percent reduction -2.70%, (95% CI -5.34, -0.04) overall and -4.45%, (95% CI -8.26, -0.64) for food.

This article identifies and discusses various methods for the interpretation of States’ general mitigation obligations in light of domestic cases. On the one hand, a top-down approach seeks to determine a State's requisite mitigation action in the light of a global objective on climate change mitigation and of effort-sharing criteria. On the other hand, bottom-up methods put emphasis on the demand for internal consistency, on the obligation for a State not to downplay its contribution to environmental impacts unfolding beyond its territory, and on various emerging transnational standards.

In this study, we evaluate the applicability of a polycentric model of governance to the implementation of mitigation and adaptation practices, as well as the presence of polycentric systems in the built environment. We assemble a database of practices with the potential to achieve both mitigation and adaptation objectives, as well as those that may be cross-purposed or that may achieve one but not the other. We review practices to gauge the applicability of a polycentric model of governance to mitigation and adaptation practices in the built environment, and examine the attributes of three existing adaptation and/or mitigation programs to assess the extent to which they exhibit polycentric attributes. We conclude with recommendations for a broader research agenda, including efforts to develop more in-depth examinations into individual programs and comparative analysis of performances of different governance attributes. © 2019 Policy Studies Organization","climate change; environment; governance; regional governance","adaptive management; climate change; comparative study; database; environmental politics; governance approach; legislative implementation; mitigation; performance assessment; regional planning; United States",,,"Blackwell Publishing Inc.",1541132X,,RPREC,,"English","Rev.

As such there is not much consolidated information available linking biochar modulated soil condition improvement and soil nutrient availability on crop yields. The present review paper addresses the above issues by compilation of world literature on biochar and a new dimension is introduced in this review by performing a meta-analysis of published data by using multivariate statistical analysis. Hence this review is a new in its kind and is useful to the broad spectrum of readers. Generally, alkalinity in biochar increases with increase in pyrolysis temperature and majority of the biochar is alkaline in nature except a few which are acidic. The N content in many biochar was reported to be more than 4% as well as less than 0.5%. Poultry litter biochar is a rich source of P (3.12%) and K (7.40%), while paper mill sludge biochar is higher in Ca content (31.1%) and swine solids biochar in Zn (49810 mg kg−1), and Fe (74800 mg kg−1) contents. The effect of biochar on enhancing soil pH was higher in Alfisol, Ferrosol and Acrisol. Soil application of biochar could on an average increase (78%), decrease (16%), or show no effect on crop yields under different soil types. Biochar produced at a lower pyrolysis temperature could deliver greater soil nutrient availabilities than that prepared at higher temperature. Principal component analysis (PCA) of available data shows an inverse relationship between [pyrolysis temperature and soil pH], and [biochar application rate and soil cation exchange capacity]. The PCA also suggests that the original soil properties and application rate strongly control crop yield stimulations via biochar amendments. Finally, biochar application shows net soil C gains while also serving for increased plant biomass production that strongly recommends biochar as a useful soil amendment. Therefore, the application of biochar to soils emerges as a ‘win-win strategy’ for sustainable waste management, climate change mitigation and food security. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Crop yields; Micronutrients; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Potassium","Alkalinity; Climate change; Crops; Food supply; Multivariant analysis; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Potassium; Principal component analysis; Pyrolysis; Waste management; Bio chars; Cation exchange capacities; Climate change mitigation; Crop yield; Micronutrients; Multivariate statistical analysis; Plant biomass production; Sustainable waste management; Soils; carbon; fertilizer; phosphorus; trace element; biochar; charcoal; alkalinity; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop yield; food security; literature review; mitigation; multivariate analysis; nitrogen; nutrient availability; nutrient dynamics; phosphorus; potassium; soil amendment; soil improvement; soil nutrient; soil quality; trace element; Article; biomass production; cation exchange; climate change; food security; harvest; nitrogen dynamics; nutrient availability; nutrient content; nutrient dynamics; physical chemistry; principal component analysis; soil; soil property; systematic review; analysis; animal; biomass; chemistry; crop; drug effect; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; soil; Suidae; Animals; Biomass; Charcoal; Crops, Agricultural; Nutrients; Soil","Purakayastha, T.J.; Division of Soil Science and Agricultural Chemistry, India; email: tpurakayastha@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",00456535,,CMSHA,"30999175","English","Chemosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064519307

The continuous GHGs emissions may lead to severe and irreversible consequences in the climate system. The reduction of GHG emissions may be not enough to mitigate climate change. Consequently, besides carbon capture from large emission sources, atmospheric CO 2 capture may be also required. To meet the target defined for climate change mitigation, the removal of 10 Gt·yr −1 of CO 2 globally by mid-century and 20 Gt·yr −1 of CO 2 globally by the end of century. The technologies applied with this aim are known as negative emission technologies (NETs), as they lead to achieve a negative balance of carbon in atmosphere. This paper aims to present the recent research works regarding NETs, focusing the research findings achieved by academic groups and projects. Besides several advantages, NETs present high operational cost and its scale-up should be tested to know the real effect on climate change mitigation. With current knowledge, no single process should be seen as a solution. Research efforts should be performed to evaluate and reduce NETs costs and environmental impact. © 2019","Atmospheric CO 2 concentration; Biochar; Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage; Negative emission technologies; Sustainability","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Atmospheric concentration; Bio chars; Bio-energy; Climate change mitigation; CO2 concentration; Emission technology; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Pre-industrial levels; Climate change; organic carbon; biochar; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (composition); emission control; greenhouse gas; sustainability; absorption; adsorption; afforestation; air pollution control; biodegradation; bioenergy; carbon balance; carbon dioxide fixation; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; carbon storage; climate change; cost control; environmental impact; gasification; land use; microalga; mineralization; negative emission technology; nonhuman; priority journal; Review; seaweed",,,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"30965264","English","Sci.

However, fossil fuels continue to receive significant amounts of government support. Although reforming fossil fuel subsidies can yield climate change mitigation benefits, the specific international and domestic political context and political economy of fossil fuel subsidies means that such reform is not straightforward and may not be aligned with traditional climate politics. Our objective in this review article is to examine the implications of the politics of fossil fuel subsidies and their reform for climate change mitigation. The first step of examining these implications is to review existing studies on the size and impacts of global fossil fuel subsidies. Subsequently, we discuss the international politics of fossil fuel subsidies, including the emerging norm of fossil fuel subsidy reform, and the respective roles played by the international climate regime and several international economic institutions. Finally, we examine why fossil fuel subsidies are introduced and maintained at the domestic level, how fossil fuel subsidy reform has functioned in practice, and whether and how such reform could be conceived as an instrument for climate policy.

Due to the complexity of the system, mitigation activities cannot completely rule out the possibility of the climate reaching a dangerous tipping point but can only reduce it to some unavoidable residual risk level. We present an online experiment based on a sample of US citizens and designed to improve our understanding of how the presence of such residual risk affects the willingness to invest into climate change mitigation. We found that, far from reducing them, the presence of residual risk actually increases investments into mitigation activities.

Identifying the aerosol variations and the underling determinates can provide insights into united mitigation policy controls targeting on both aerosol pollution and climate change. Long-term trend analysis and modeling offers an effective way to fully appreciate how aerosols interlink with carbon cycle and climate change. This study analyzes the current trends, models the future predictions, and investigates potential driving forces of aerosol loading at six sites across North America and East Asia during 2003–2015. Satellite-retrieved MODIS Collection 6 retrievals and ground measurements derived from AERONET are used. Results show that there is a persistent decreasing trend in AOD for both MODIS data and AERONET data at three sites. Monthly and seasonal AOD variations reveal consistent aerosol patterns at sites along mid-latitudes. Regional differences caused by impacts of climatology and land cover types are observed for the selected sites. Statistical validation of time series ARIMA models indicates that the non-seasonal ARIMA model performs better for AERONET AOD data than for MODIS AOD data at most sites, suggesting the method works better for data with higher quality. The seasonal ARIMA model reproduces time series with distinct seasonal variations much more precisely. The reasonably predicted AOD values could provide reliable estimates to better inform the decision-making for sustainable environmental management. Drawn from aerosol pollution control strategies, it is suggested that the enforcement of regulations on emission sources and the initiative of reforestation on emission sinks could have potential implications for climate change mitigation. © 2019","Aerosol optical depth; ARIMA; Climate change mitigation; MODIS C6; Time series","Aerosols; Air pollution; Decision making; Environmental management; Pollution control; Radiometers; Reforestation; Sustainable development; Time series; Aerosol optical depths; ARIMA; Climate change mitigation; Enforcement of regulations; MODIS C6; Seasonal ARIMA models; Statistical validation; Sustainable environmental management; Climate change","Li, X.; Department of Geography, United States; email: xueke.li@uconn.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Several studies show the effects of investment minimization policies and the replacement of nuclear power plants with renewables. This implies economic impacts on the price of electricity, which increases the use of fossil fuels resulting in health problems related to air pollution and increasing costs to reduce the carbon emitted in the world.

The commitment under the Paris Agreement to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change has indirectly forced many countries to support the efforts for RE generation. This energy transition from unsustainable fossil fuels to RE was demonstrated by the promulgation of various laws and policies at national, regional and international levels. Aligned with that, Malaysia has also taken several measures in mitigating climate change impacts and accelerating RE development. Thus, this study focuses on the importance of RE generation as part of the climate mitigation regime with reference to the Renewable Energy Act 2011 (Act 725). This study adopts a black-letter approach through statute analysis. Throughout this paper, it was suggested that the Renewable Energy Act 2011 failed to address climate change issues properly.

Forest landscape restoration and other restorative ecosystem management activities are important measures that contribute towards reaching the objectives of the Bonn Challenge, which aims to restore 350 million hectares by 2030. In this context, many restoration projects are being planned and implemented in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). We present an overview of the location, goals and activities, and an estimated climate change mitigation potential of 154 recent, ongoing and planned restoration projects in LAC. Our analysis suggests that most projects are located in the humid tropics and less attention is paid to drylands. Increasing vegetation cover, biodiversity recovery and recovery of ecological processes are the most common goals. Restorative activities to fulfil these goals were diverse and were related to the type and source of funding that projects receive. For example, projects implemented through the Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) generally rely on natural or assisted regeneration over large areas ( > 20,000 ha), whereas Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects establish forest plantations, often including exotic monocultures, in smaller project areas ( < 5000 ha). Projects that are specifically implemented within the scope of Initiative 20 × 20 and other local initiatives that target the local environmental problems, are more varied and rely on a wider portfolio of restorative activities, such as erosion control, exclusion of grazing and mixed plantations. These projects are usually implemented in smaller project areas ( < 5000 ha). All projects had the potential to contribute to climate change mitigation by storing additional forest aboveground biomass through natural regeneration, assisted regeneration or establishing a plantation. Further analysis of the implemented activities is an important next step to investigate their effectiveness in terms of goals achieved under Initiative 20 × 20 and the Bonn Challenge. This would provide information for future restoration projects and upscaling of restorative activities in a wider area. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Comparative analysis; Ecological restoration; Forest biomass; Forest landscape restoration; Latin America and the Caribbean","Biodiversity; Conservation; Emission control; Investments; Land reclamation; Reforestation; Restoration; Climate change mitigation; Comparative analysis; Ecological restoration; Forest biomass; Forest landscape restoration; Latin America and the Caribbean; Climate change; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; comparative study; forest dynamics; landscape protection; mitigation; restoration ecology; America; Biodiversity; Conservation; Land Reclamation; Reforestation; Restoration; Caribbean Islands; Latin America","Romijn, E.; Wageningen University and Research (WUR), Droevendaalsesteeg 3, Netherlands; email: erika.romijn@wur.nl",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068875291

Here, we develop a simple socio-climate model by coupling an Earth system model to a social dynamics model. We treat social processes endogenously— emerging from rules governing how individuals learn socially and how social norms develop —as well as being influenced by climate change and mitigation costs. Our goal is to gain qualitative insights into scenarios of potential socio-climate dynamics and to illustrate how such models can generate new research questions. We find that the social learning rate is strongly influential, to the point that variation of its value within empirically plausible ranges changes the peak global temperature anomaly by more than 1˚C. Conversely, social norms reinforce majority behaviour and therefore may not provide help when we most need it because they suppress the early spread of mitigative behaviour. Finally, exploring the model’s parameter space for mitigation cost and social learning suggests optimal intervention pathways for climate change mitigation. We find that prioritising an increase in social learning as a first step, followed by a reduction in mitigation costs provides the most efficient route to a reduced peak temperature anomaly. We conclude that socio-climate models should be included in the ensemble of models used to project climate change. © 2019 Bury et al.",,"adult; article; climate change; human; social learning; social norm; biology; climate change; energy conservation; greenhouse effect; prevention and control; social change; theoretical model; Climate Change; Computational Biology; Conservation of Energy Resources; Global Warming; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Social Change","Buryid, T.M.; Department of Applied Mathematics, Canada; email: tbury@uwaterloo.ca",,"Public Library of Science",1553734X,,,"31170149","English","PLoS Comput.

However, there is still very little understanding of the factors that influence household-level mitigation and adaptation action. From a review of literature, we identified the factors that potentially influence climate mitigation and adaptation actions of households, which we then tested using survey data from 622 households in Nuevo Leon, Mexico. Nuevo Leon is a major emitter of greenhouse gasses and is a state where climate-related disasters are recurrent and expected to increase in frequency and severity. Results from ordinal regression analyses showed that perceived knowledge and financial self-efficacy greatly influenced the extent of household-level action taken. To a lesser extent, the age and educational level of the respondent also affected action. Respondents pointed out the need to know about different aspects of climate change. An implication of our study is the value of recognizing the importance of perceptions, as mitigation and adaptation actions are shaped by perceptions of climate change alongside socio-demographic characteristics.

It uses research on climate change mitigation in China and India to explore how government agencies seek to overcome challenges of limited capacity and competing priorities by bundling climate change together with more immediate priorities and thereby developing a coalition with an interest in achieving these objectives. The article is based on interviews conducted in China and India, as well as analysis of themes covered in the growing body of literature on the domestic politics of climate change mitigation. In both countries we found that pragmatic approaches leveraging what already exists made significant progress in putting energy efficiency on the agenda, strengthening institutional presence (in India) and delivering improvements in energy efficiency (in China). Yet, we also found that the use of these tactics had significant limitations. While there was probably no other way that the policy space given to climate change mitigation could have increased so rapidly, there are significant side effects that arise as a result of the traction gained by these initial policy approaches. While bundling raised the profile of energy efficiency, it also created perverse incentives that highlight the need to consider the long-term effect on the interests, capacity and sustainability of informal coalitions. We highlight the need to take account of both the short- and long-term effects of thinking and working politically, and the challenges of doing so when the outcomes are unpredictable and inherently difficult to assess. © The Authors 2018.

This study examines whether threat to the socioeconomic system in the form of climate change mitigation policies, referred to as Climate Change Mitigation Threat (CCMT), mediates the relationships between Right-Wing Authoritarianism (RWA) and Social Dominance Orientation (SDO) subtypes and four forms of climate change denial (existence denial, human cause denial, impact denial and climate science denial). U.S. participants (N = 334; Mage = 34.70, SD = 5.98) were recruited via Amazon MTurk. When shared variance in the predictors was accounted for, we found that: (a) Conventionalism (RWA-C) positively predicted all forms of climate change denial; (b) Dominance (SDO-D) positively predicted existence denial; (c) Anti-Egalitarianism (SDO-E) positively predicted both human cause and impact denial; and (d) Aggression (RWA-A) negatively predicted existence denial. All significant direct relationships were partially mediated by CCMT, except for the direct paths between SDO-D and existence denial, and RWA-A and existence denial. These findings suggest that right-wing adherents who conform to societal norms and prefer unequal social systems may deny climate change partly due to a perception that mitigation strategies proposed to combat climate change threaten the existing socioeconomic system. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"adult; aggression; article; authority; climate change; controlled study; human; ideology; major clinical study; perception; social dominance; social norm; wing","Clarke, E.J.R.; School of Health and Life Sciences, Australia; email: ej.clarke@federation.edu.au",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00219029,,,,"English","J.

However, many contemporary forms of well-being attainment still depend heavily on the use of fossil fuel derived energy. Therefore, certain necessary forms of climate change mitigation are likely to conflict with current means of well-being attainment in many groups and societies. In particular our concern is that certain forms of mitigation, which target lifestyle choices, consumption behaviour, and technological choices, do and will have disproportionate impacts on certain vulnerable groups in society e.g. households in fuel poverty or individuals with particular disabilities. It is evident that climate change mitigation discourse has only sparsely integrated well-being thought. We argue that a fuller integration of well-being into mitigation thinking could help avoid exacerbating current and future well-being conflicts that will arise between climate change mitigation and fossil fuel derived use. To help achieve this, we reason that climate change mitigation and fossil fuel derived use must not be viewed separately but by their relationships to well-being. We articulate the individual processes of fossil fuel derived energy use, climate change mitigation and well-being attainment in more detail, presenting their relationships to one another in the form of tensions. We present a capabilities conception of well-being that we argue is best suited for operationalising well-being with regards to fully capturing these tensions. We then develop a conceptual framework through a theoretical synthesis of existing on well-being, energy, and climate change, which illustrates how these tensions arise. This framework also serves to illustrate how a change in one process will affect the others. We outline how this framework can help illustrate the points at which misguided climate change mitigation can conflict with current means of attaining well-being from fossil derived energy. We then conclude that the use of this framework and further integration of well-being thought could help avoid and ameliorate well-being conflicts when developing future climate change mitigation. © 2019 The Authors","Capabilities; Climate change; Energy justice; Ethics; Fossil fuels; Justice; Mitigation; Well-being",,"Wood, N.; Sustainability Research Institute, United Kingdom; email: eenwo@leeds.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

This allows no sector to maintain business as usual practices, while application of the precautionary principle requires avoiding a reliance on negative emission technologies. Animal to plant-sourced protein shifts offer substantial potential for GHG emission reductions. Unabated, the livestock sector could take between 37% and 49% of the GHG budget allowable under the 2°C and 1.5°C targets, respectively, by 2030. Inaction in the livestock sector would require substantial GHG reductions, far beyond what are planned or realistic, from other sectors. This outlook article outlines why animal to plant-sourced protein shifts should be taken up by the Conference of the Parties (COP), and how they could feature as part of countries’ mitigation commitments under their updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to be adopted from 2020 onwards. The proposed framework includes an acknowledgment of ‘peak livestock’, followed by targets for large and rapid reductions in livestock numbers based on a combined ‘worst first’ and ‘best available food’ approach. Adequate support, including climate finance, is needed to facilitate countries in implementing animal to plant-sourced protein shifts. Key policy insights Given the livestock sector’s significant contribution to global GHG emissions and methane dominance, animal to plant protein shifts make a necessary contribution to meeting the Paris temperature goals and reducing warming in the short term, while providing a suite of co-benefits. Without action, the livestock sector could take between 37% and 49% of the GHG budget allowable under the 2°C and 1.5°C targets, respectively, by 2030. Failure to implement animal to plant protein shifts increases the risk of exceeding temperate goals; requires additional GHG reductions from other sectors; and increases reliance on negative emissions technologies. COP 24 is an opportunity to bring animal to plant protein shifts to the climate mitigation table.

However, the potential to mitigate some of these emissions through the adoption of more efficient farm management practices may be hampered by farmers’ awareness and attitude towards climate change and agriculture’s role in contributing to GHG emissions. This paper presents results from a survey of 746 Irish farmers in 2014, with a view to understanding farmers’ awareness of, and attitudes to, climate change and GHG emissions. Survey results show that there was a general uncertainty towards a number of questions related to agricultural GHG emissions, e.g. if tilling of land causes GHG emissions, and that farmers were reluctant to take action to reduce GHG emissions on their farm. To further explore farmers’ attitudes towards climate change, a multinomial logit model was used to examine the socio-economic factors that affect farmers’ willingness to adopt an advisory tool that would show the potential reduction in GHG emissions from the adoption of new technologies. Results show that farmers’ awareness of human-induced global climate change was positively related to the tool’s adoption. Key policy insights Irish farmers are generally not sufficiently aware of the impact of their activities on climate change. A quarter of farmers believed that climate change will only impact on their business in the long-term; such an attitude may lead to a reluctance amongst these farmers to adopt management practices that reduce GHG emissions. Awareness of climate change affects positively the adoption of new tools to reduce GHG emissions on farmers’ farms. IT literacy affects willingness to adopt new tools to address GHG emissions. Reception of agri-environmental advice can have a positive influence on farmers’ willingness to adopt new GHG emission abatement tools. Farmers in receipt of environmental subsidies are more likely to adopt new abatement tools, either because they are more environmentally conscious or because the subsidy raised their environmentally consciousness. Willingness to adopt differs between different farm enterprises; operating dairy enterprise increases the willingness to adopt new advisory mitigation tools. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","advisory tool; awareness; Climate change; technology adoption","agricultural practice; carbon emission; climate change; farmers attitude; greenhouse gas; socioeconomic indicator; subsidy system; technology adoption; Ireland","Tzemi, D.; Lincoln International Business School, Brayford Pool, United Kingdom; email: dtzemi@lincoln.ac.uk",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

Additionally, policy relevant factors influencing WTP for air travel emissions reductions were investigated. The results suggest that mean WTP is higher in the low-cost setting associated with short-distance flights (495 SEK/ tCO 2 ; 50 EUR/ tCO 2 ) than for long-distance flights (295 SEK/ tCO 2 ; 30 EUR/t CO 2 ). The respondents were more likely to be willing to pay the air ticket tax if they were not frequent flyers, if they were women, had a left political view, if they had a sense of responsibility for their emissions and if they preferred earmarking revenues from the tax for climate change mitigation and sustainable transport projects. Key policy insights A mandatory air ticket tax is a viable policy option that might receive majority support among the population. While a carbon-based air ticket tax promises to be an effective tool to generate revenues, its potential steering effect appears to be lower for low cost contexts (short-distance flights) than for high cost contexts (long-distance flights). Policy consistency regarding the tax base and its revenue use may increase public acceptability of (higher) air ticket taxes. Earmarking revenues is clearly preferred to tax recycling or general budget use. Insights about the personal drivers behind WTP for emissions reductions from air travel can help to inform targeting and segmentation of policy interventions. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Accounting for ancillary positive health outcomes (health co-benefits) that result from implementing climate change mitigation policies can provide Parties to the Paris Agreement with a sound rationale for introducing stronger mitigation strategies. Despite this recognition, a knowledge gap exists on the role of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies. To address this gap, the case study presented here investigates the role of health co-benefits in the development of European Union (EU) climate change mitigation policies through analysis and consideration of semi-structured interview data, government documents, journal articles and media releases. We find that while health co-benefits are an explicit consideration in the development of EU climate change mitigation policies, their influence on final policy outcomes has been limited. Our analysis suggests that whilst health co-benefits are a key driver of air pollution mitigation policies, climate mitigation policies are primarily driven by other factors, including economic costs and energy implications. Key policy insights Health co-benefits are quantified and monetized as part of the development of EU climate change mitigation policies but their influence on the final policies agreed upon is limited. Barriers, such as the immediate economic costs associated with climate action, inhibit the influence of health co-benefits on the development of mitigation policies. Health co-benefits primarily drive the development of EU air pollution mitigation policies. The separation of responsibility for GHG and non-GHG emissions across Directorate Generals has decoupled climate change and air pollution mitigation policies, with consequences for the integration of health co-benefits in climate policy. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ancillary benefits; Climate change mitigation; policy formation; public health","atmospheric pollution; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; policy development; public health; Europe","Workman, A.; Australian-German Climate and Energy College, Level 1, 187 Grattan Street, Australia; email: a.workman@student.unimelb.edu.au",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

Energy retrofitting of existing buildings is a central strategy in climate mitigation and has often been highlighted as a cost-effective strategy. However, decisions on these strategies are often hampered by modeling assessments that are limited by contextual, methodological, parametric, input, or output constraints. Here, we present a novel methodology to investigate the solid economic feasibility in building retrofit evaluations with mitigation measures. We first calculate the variations in the energy saving potentials and costs for 13 energy saving measures and five climate change scenarios. We then compare the obtained uncertainty due to a changing climate to other uncertainties, such as the boundaries for emission inventories and energy system development. Four cities in Sweden are modeled, which are responsible for half of the country's residential energy use. We find that the profitability of the retrofitting actions is primarily determined based on the annualized investments and energy saving potentials. Future climate has a less determinant role, with uncertainties similar to those of future consumer price development and fuel emission factors. Retrofits that only affect the energy need for space heating are more robust than changes in electricity usage. We conclude that strategies for building retrofitting should focus on prioritizing energy savings and mobilizing investments that may not be profitable based on the current techno-economic perspective. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building stock modelling; Climate change; CO2 mitigation; Cost-efficient renovation; Swedish residential buildings; Uncertainty","Cost effectiveness; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Housing; Investments; Profitability; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Uncertainty analysis; Building stocks; CO2 mitigation; Cost-efficient; Residential building; Uncertainty; Climate change; alternative energy; building; carbon dioxide; climate change; cost analysis; economic activity; economic conditions; electricity; emission inventory; energy resource; feasibility study; heating; price determination; profitability; residential energy; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; urban area; Sweden","Mata, É.; Climate & Sustainable Cities, Box 530 21, Sweden; email: erika.mata@ivl.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

ETCAP simulation model was used to forecast forest development for Pozantı area with 17,603 ha forests in Turkey. Wood production, biodiversity conservation, carbon sequestration and water provision were the primary ecosystem services. The species composition, natural composition, key habitats and understory vegetation are maintained and small forest openings were left intact for wildlife. Some forest areas were allowed to develop older to provide better opportunities of biodiversity conservation. The increase of carbon stock was related to age class shifts to older stages due mainly to increasing afforestation areas and productivity. The marginal differences in total carbon balance were related to a smaller increase in volume increment in BAU scenario and a higher allocation of harvest to energy production for the LIM and HIM scenarios. The planning scenarios allowed better production of water runoffs with slight differences among the output of management scenarios. The prevailing variable was the areas of afforestation. The impacts of a forest management scenario on ecosystem services highly depend on the development rate and intensity of management interventions. © 2019","Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate change; Forest management; Simulation; Water","carbon; ground water; water; carbon; water; afforestation; age class; biodiversity; carbon; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation; ecosystem service; forest management; simulation; timber; water; Article; biodiversity; carbon balance; carbon sequestration; case study; climate change; conservation biology; energy yield; forest management; habitat; harvest; species composition; Turkey (republic); vegetation; water quality; wildlife; wood; animal; biodiversity; ecosystem; environmental protection; forest; forestry; turkey (bird); Turkey; Animals; Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Forestry; Forests; Turkey; Water",,,"Academic Press",03014797,,JEVMA,"30870674","English","J.

While differences in climate vulnerability are a deterrent for cooperation, increasing the effectiveness of adaptation in highly vulnerable countries can foster an IEA. Both traditional free riding on climate change mitigation efforts, and free riding on adaptation technology among members of an IEA can be reduced by transfers of adaptation technology within the IEA.

Meanwhile, food security is a high-priority area in the UN Sustainable Development Goals, which could potentially be adversely affected by stringent climate mitigation. Here we show the potential negative trade-offs between food security and climate mitigation using a multi-model comparison exercise. We find that carelessly designed climate mitigation policies could increase the number of people at risk of hunger by 160 million in 2050. Avoiding these adverse side effects would entail a cost of about 0.18% of global gross domestic product in 2050. It should be noted that direct impacts of climate change on yields were not assessed and that the direct benefits from mitigation in terms of avoided yield losses could be substantial, further reducing the above cost. Although results vary across models and model implementations, the qualitative implications are robust and call for careful design of climate mitigation policies taking into account agriculture and land prices. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Climate models; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Adverse side effects; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Food security; Gross domestic products; Model implementation; Number of peoples; Pre-industrial levels; Climate change","Fujimori, S.; Department of Environmental Engineering, Japan; email: sfujimori@athehost.env.kyoto-u.ac.jp",,"Nature Publishing Group",23989629,,,,"English","Nature Sustain.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065708446

However to motivate households and policy makers to climate action, one should also point out the health opportunities of climate change mitigation measures. We draw on the current literature to present the concept of health co-benefits of climate change mitigation measures (A). In the empirical part of the paper we first use a quantitative and qualitative text analysis to look at the link of climate change and health in EU legislation from 1990–2015 (B). We then describe results from qualitative in-depth interviews with 18 German households, in which we investigate how knowledge of health co-benefits influences households in implementing climate action. The interviews were part of a bigger European mixed-methods study. A: From the household perspective, we define direct health co-benefits, which can be influenced and experienced by an individual, and indirect health co-benefits, which are dependent on societal action. B: Health is mentioned in EU climate change legislation. However, EU legislation only touches upon health co-benefits in general and doesn’t mention direct health co-benefits at all. C: Households consider health co-benefits in their lifestyle decisions. Yet, as there are many determinants of lifestyle, information on health co-benefits alone does not seem to be sufficient to trigger climate friendly and healthy behavior. First, synergies between health and climate change mitigation need to be recognized on a political level. Then, effective intersectoral policies need to be implemented to support households on multiple levels in implementing healthy and climate-friendly lifestyles. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Deutschland, ein Teil von Springer Nature.","EU; Health co-benefits; Lifestyle; Policies; Structural prevention","climate change; household; interview; law; lifestyle; quantitative analysis; review; touch; Germany; health behavior; Climate Change; Germany; Health Behavior","Herrmann, A.; Heidelberger Institut für Global Health, Im Neuenheimer Feld 130.3, Germany; email: alina.herrmann@uni-heidelberg.de",,"Springer Verlag",14369990,,,"30949718","German","Bundesgesund.blatt.

The present research quantitatively assesses the potential impact of these strategies on primary material footprint (MF) and carbon footprint (CF) of households in areas an urban area, using the case of Brussels Capital Region (BCR), Belgium. Because the CE-strategies are linked to consumption domains, this assessment first calculates both footprints of consumption domains using a city-level input-output analysis and discusses the relationship between the footprints. The findings show that the carbon footprint of BCR in 2010 was 22 Mt CO 2 -eq. or 20.3 t/cap. The material footprint of BCR in 2010 was 31 Mt or 29.5 t/cap. Important insights are that BCR relies on its hinterland for 98% of its primary materials and 83% of the region's greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) are emitted outside of its territory. The household consumption domains of food, housing and transport were identified as hotspots in both footprints. Within these domains, we calculated and discussed the potential impact on both footprints of CE-strategies on consumption or production of food, mobility and housing. Results from this case show that with these strategies Brussels could mitigate 25% of its CF and 26% of its MF, 18% of its CF and 26% of its MF, and 7% of its CF and 10% of its MF, respectively.

Among others, the “Covenant of Mayors for Climate and Energy” is the most acknowledged, providing local governments with the opportunity to overcome the mitigation-adaptation dichotomy and enhance urban resilience. In this context, the main aim of this paper is to analyse the synergy between adaptation and mitigation actions in some European Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plans at an urban level. We will do this through: (1) the proposal of a novel classification model of climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, which will be capable of classifying, in a common way, the best practices carried out at an urban level; and (2) a comparison of the best climate change management practices carried out by two European countries (Italy and Spain). The classification model is based on three urban sectors: (1) Urban Adaptation and Health (UA&H), (2) Transport & Infrastructure (T&I), and (3) Energy (NRG). Urban management measures have been classified as soft (more focused on environmental information), gray (more focused on buildings), and green (more focused on nature-based solutions). The overall comparative analysis between Italy and Spain shows that in large and medium-sized Italian cities, mainly soft (52%) and green (28%) adaptation measures have been integrated into local energy-environmental planning in combination with mitigation actions. However, in both countries, decisions regarding the type of measures to be implemented are taken independently of the size of the city. This paper, in line with other research, highlights the importance of nature-based solutions as a first step in the integration process between adaptation and mitigation strategies at an urban level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation strategies; Mitigation strategies; SECAPs; Urban adaptive capacity; Urban resilience","article; city; climate change; environmental planning; Italy; Spain","Valente, D.; Lab. of Landscape Ecology, Italy; email: donatella.valente@unisalento.it",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

In order to effectively and satisfactorily tackle climate change, a legally and politically binding long-term policy architecture is needed. In practice, however, central governments and international policymakers have been unable to provide a successful policy architecture. Yet, city-level initiatives within the Smart City framework are a promising way to tackle climate change. An example of such a Smart City framework is the London Environment Strategy (LES). In this paper, we propose a zero mean reverting model for greenhouse gas emissions to quantitatively analyze its consistency with the 2050 Zero Carbon objectives. We consider different policy scenarios proposed in the LES and the forward-looking policy uncertainty embedded in different economic sectors, primarily domestic, industrial and commercial and transport. We find that, on average, only transport improves the historical greenhouse gas emissions trend, and most of this reduction comes from Smart Mobility and/or Smart Regulation programs focusing on the environment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Inter-temporal discounting; Mean reverting; Policy uncertainty; Smart City","Decision making; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Smart city; Climate change mitigation; Decision making process; Inter-temporal discounting; Long-term policies; Mean reverting; Policy architecture; Regulation projects; Scientific community; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; smart city; uncertainty analysis; England; London [England]; United Kingdom","Platania, F.; Léonard de Vinci Pôle Universitaire, France; email: federico.platania@devinci.fr",,"Elsevier Inc.",00401625,,,,"English","Technol.

One of the main ways to assess external benefit of climate change mitigation in energy sector is to conduct Willingness to Pay (WTP) assessments for climate change mitigation options by households. There are many studies on WTP assessment for climate stability conducted in recent years. The paper surveys the existing literature on WTP for climate change mitigation policy in the energy sector. The aim of the paper is to identify the common variables across a varied set of WTP studies in order to establish a basis for comparison. The key variables selected for analysis of WTP studies for climate change mitigation in energy sector addressed in the paper are: the WTP assessment methods; the main attributes used for comparing alternatives in WTP studies, targeted climate change mitigation policies in energy sector, mathematical model used to estimate WTP, the main socio-demographic factors having impact on WTP for climate change mitigation policies. The analysis of WTP studies for climate change mitigation is grouped in two areas: renewables and energy efficiency measures in households. The paper provides analytical structure for future studies to evaluate the effects of variation in key comparative elements upon WTP. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; Energy efficiency improvements; Renewables; Willingness to pay; WTP","Climate models; Energy efficiency; Analytical structure; Climate change mitigation; Climate stability; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency improvements; Renewables; Socio-demographic factors; Willingness to pay; Climate change","Simanaviciene, Z.; Faculty of Economics and Business Economics, Ateities g. 20, Lithuania; email: zasiman@mruni.eu",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065493959

A second project focused on public understanding about carbon dioxide’s residence time in the atmosphere. In both projects, we applied the mental-models approach, which aims to design effective communications by using insights from interdisciplinary teams of experts and mental models elicited from intended audience members. In addition to summarizing our findings, we discuss the process of interdisciplinary collaboration that we pursued in framing and completing both projects.

Based on stakeholder interviews and content analysis of strategies and projects relevant to climate adaptation and mitigation in the cities of Copenhagen and Helsinki, we present empirical examples of synergies, conflicts and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation that are driven by the cross-scale interactions. These examples show that jurisdictional and institutional scales shape the implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies, projects and tasks at the management scale, creating benefits of integrated solutions, but also challenges. Investigating the linkages between adaptation and mitigation through a scale framework provides new knowledge for urban climate change planning and decision-making.

Reduced-impact logging for climate (RIL-C) is proposed as a way to maintain timber production while minimizing forest damage. Here we synthesize data from 61 coordinated field-based surveys of logging impacts in seven countries across the tropics. We estimate that tropical selective logging emitted 834 Tg CO 2 in 2015, 6% of total tropical greenhouse gas emissions. Felling, hauling, and skidding caused 59%, 31%, and 10% of these emissions, respectively. We suggest that RIL-C incentive programs consider a feasible target carbon impact factor of 2.3 Mg emitted per Mg of timber extracted. Operational modifications are needed to achieve this target, such as reduced wood waste, narrower haul roads, and lower impact skidding equipment. Full implementation would reduce logging emissions by 44% (366 Tg CO 2 year −1 ) and deliver 4% of the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Climate Agreement from tropical countries, while maintaining timber supplies. © 2019 The Authors",,"Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Logging (forestry); Magnesium; Skidding; Timber; Tropics; Climate agreement; Climate change mitigation; Incentive programs; Operational modifications; Reduced-impact logging; Timber production; Tropical countries; Tropical greenhouse; C (programming language); carbon emission; climate change; ecological impact; emission; emission control; environmental degradation; field survey; forestry production; greenhouse gas; implementation process; incentive; international agreement; mitigation; selective logging; tropical forest; Carbon Dioxide; Greenhouse Gases; Impact; Magnesium; Selective Cutting; Skidding; Tropics","Ellis, P.W.; The Nature Conservancy, 4245 Fairfax Avenue, Suite 100, United States; email: pellis@tnc.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

An experiment with a US sample found, contrary to previous research, that reading about geoengineering did not reduce conservatives’ skepticism about the existence of anthropogenic climate change. Moreover, depending on how it is framed, geoengineering can reduce support for mitigation among both conservatives and non-conservatives. When geoengineering is framed as a major solution, people worry less about climate change, leading to reduced mitigation support. When framed as disastrous, people perceived geoengineering as riskier, also leading to a decrease in mitigation support. A more moderate framing of geoengineering as a partial solution is less susceptible to moral hazard effects. Overall, results suggest that geoengineering will not lessen political polarization over anthropogenic climate change, and could undercut support for mitigation efforts.

A questionnaire survey of the URT users was conducted to observe the behavioural changes. Positive effects of rail projects in terms of attracting car users to the new travel modes have been evidenced, resulting in a significant extent of carbon emission reductions, which signifies a contribution to sustainable urban mobility and climate change mitigation.

Changes in farming practices are necessary to reduce emissions and to adapt to climate change. However, such modifications to common practices depend, to a large extent, on farmers' knowledge and attitudes towards climate risks. An empirical study of farmers' attitudes and knowledge of climate change mitigation and adaptation practices is useful to understand how farmers' knowledge influences their attitudes and practices towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. Based on a case study characterised by four agricultural farming systems (extensive dairy sheep, intensive dairy cattle, horticultural farming, and rice farming) in the Province of Oristano in Italy, this study contains an investigation of (i) farmers' knowledge of climate change causes and effects, how they construct such knowledge, and how they adapt to the phenomenon; (ii) what and how are farmers' attitudes towards climate change causes are shaped under their contextual social interests and values; and (iii) if their practices in responding to climate variability are influenced by their constructed knowledge. The research results showed that farmers' declarative knowledge of climate change did not affect their adaptation practices but directed farmers’ attitudes towards climate change causes. The findings also underscore the necessity of facilitating social learning spaces for enhancing virtuous behaviours towards climate change mitigation and the sharing and co-production of procedural knowledge for developing shared sustainable climate adaptation practices at the farm level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude; Farming systems; Knowledge; Practice; Social construction","adaptive management; agricultural worker; climate change; farmers attitude; farming system; knowledge; local adaptation; social construction; Italy; Oristano; Sardinia; Bos; Ovis aries","Nguyen, T.P.L.; Department of Development and Sustainability, 58 Moo 9, Km.42, P.O.

However, the deployment of renewable energies at scale requires not only public but also private capital, such as foreign direct investment (FDI). Many countries with favourable conditions for renewables, such as the countries of the Middle East and North African (MENA) region, are not attracting sufficient FDI. Risk perceptions of FDI stakeholders are one of the reasons. This paper discusses the de-risking approach as a possible tool to address subjective risk perceptions and assesses with a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model macroeconomic feedback-effects of employing a de-risking strategy for FDI into a particular kind of renewable electricity (RES-E) technology, concentrated solar power, in the MENA region. Our results show that the application of a de-risking approach reduces the costs for deployment of CSP, and therefore, also volumes of subsidies that would be needed to make CSP cost competitive with fossil fuel based electricity generation. This, in turn, leads to positive GDP and welfare effects in the MENA region. Our results allow us developing of recommendations for energy policy the implementation of the de-risking approach as a potential consensual option with high political feasibility to reduce climate change mitigation costs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","De-risking approach; Foreign direct investment; Middle East and North African region; Renewable energy sources","Cost reduction; Developing countries; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Investments; Natural resources; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Solar energy; Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium model; Concentrated solar power; De-risking; Electricity generation; Foreign direct investments; Middle East; Renewable energy source; Climate change; alternative energy; climate change; cost analysis; developing world; energy policy; foreign direct investment; renewable resource; Middle East; North Africa","Komendantova, N.; Advanced Systems Analysis Program, Austria; email: komendan@iiasa.ac.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059147603

This transition takes place at multiple and complementary scales, including bottom-up approaches such as community-based initiatives (CBIs). However, empirical research on CBIs has focused until now on anecdotal evidence and little work has been done to quantitatively assess their impact in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this paper, we analyze 38 European initiatives across the food, energy, transport, and waste sectors to address the following questions: How can the GHG reduction potential of CBIs be quantified and analyzed in a systematic manner across different sectors? What is the GHG mitigation potential of CBIs and how does the reduction potential differ across domains? Through the comparison of the emission intensity arising from the goods and services the CBIs provide in relation to a business-as-usual scenario, we present the potential they have across different activities. This constitutes the foundational step to upscaling and further understanding their potential contribution to achieving climate change mitigation targets. Our findings indicate that energy generation through renewable sources, changes in personal transportation, and dietary change present by far the highest GHG mitigation activities analyzed, since they reduce the carbon footprint of CBI beneficiaries by 24%, 11%, and 7%, respectively. In contrast, the potential for some activities, such as locally grown organic food, is limited. The service provided by these initiatives only reduces the carbon footprint by 0.1%. Overall, although the proliferation of CBIs is very desirable from a climate change mitigation perspective it is necessary to stress that bottom-up initiatives present other important positive dimensions besides GHG mitigation. These initiatives also hold the potential of improving community resilience by strengthening local economies and enhancing social cohesion. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon footprint; Grassroots initiatives; Greenhouse gas emissions; Low carbon economy; Sustainability transitions; Sustainable lifestyles",,"Landholm, D.M.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Germany; email: landholm@pik-potsdam.de",,"Springer Verlag",14363798,,,,"English","Reg.

In the European Union (EU), cities are expanding their urban green infrastructure (UGI)to reduce the effects of climate change and enhance resilience and sustainability. However, there exist few articles showing local case studies in intermediate cities of Europe. The aim of this study is to analyse the climate change mitigation potential of a set of urban forests and agriculture actions implemented within the EU LIFE Program, in the northern Spain city of Lugo. First, the amount of CO2 reduced by the UGI was calculated, also considering the emissions released from their implementation and management (I&amp;M). In addition, the ecological balance was estimated, as an indicator to determine the sustainability of the UGI actions. Both biocapacity and quantity of emissions during I&amp;M were found to be significantly different between the urban agriculture and urban forestry actions, showing that the type of UGI selected and its management has a great influence on the final carbon uptake. The global ecological balance was equal to 1.85 Global hectares, indicating that the evaluated UGI actions are effective at contributing to the climate change mitigation, in addition to other great co-benefits. Nonetheless, carbon uptake was 0.26 t C ha-1 per year, which is in the lower range compared to other cities in Europe. The quantification of benefits of this individual city experience is important to increase the attention of policies and management plans on UGI. © 2018 Elsevier GmbH","Biocapacity; Carbon dioxide reduction; Ecological footprint; Sustainable urban development","carbon dioxide; climate change; ecological footprint; ecosystem resilience; emission control; European Union; greenspace; infrastructure; sustainable development; urban agriculture; urban development; urban forestry; Galicia [Spain]; Lugo [Galicia]; Spain","De la Sota, C.; Innovation and Technology for Development Center, Av.

Agriculture contributes 25% of global greenhouse gas emissions of which seed bed preparation has a significant share. It contributes 23–44% of total CO 2 emissions due to fossil fuel consumption and soil organic carbon oxidation. Increasing consciousness on environment and food security has created interest towards low-energy agriculture and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Hence identification of a primary tillage implement can be a powerful strategy to mitigate the climate change through reduced fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) for cleaner agricultural production and to improve the environment quality. Therefore, the present study focuses on identifying the energy efficient and environment friendly primary tillage implement by analyzing the energy and carbon efficiency indicators. The objective of the present study was to assess the effect of commonly used primary and secondary tillage implements in single or in combination for seed bed preparation in developing countries like Cultivator (CV), Cultivator followed by Disc Harrow (CVH), Disc Plough (DP), Disc Plough followed by Disc Harrow (DH), Mould Board Plough (MP), Mould Board Plough followed by Disc Harrow (MPH), Rotovator (RO), Bullock Drawn Plough (BP), Bullock Drawn Harrow (BH), No Tillage (NT) on energy conservation, environment impact and global warming potential. The aim of the study was to identify climate smart primary tillage implement for clean production technology to improve the environmental quality in semi-arid rainfed conditions of India. CV, MP and RO recorded higher soil based greenhouse gas emissions. NT and Animal Drawn Implements recorded lower soil-based greenhouse gas emissions. Fuel consumption-based CO 2 emissions for preparatory cultivation and sowing were found to be 92, 81, 60, 60 and 40 per cent lower in BP, BH, tractor drawn CV, DH, RO respectively as compared to MPH RO and MPH f recorded higher total CO 2 equivalents over other tillage implements used in the present experiment. Among the different methods, reduced tillage with DH recorded higher energy use efficiency and carbon efficiency. Our study indicated that primary tillage implement with minimum soil disturbance and lower number of operations is an ideal environment friendly practice for mitigation of climate change as it recorded low Global Warming Potential (GWP), energy and cost of cultivation with minimum yield reduction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Clean environment; Cleaner production; Climate smart implement; Energy use; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas emissions; Primary tillage","Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Developing countries; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Mineral resources; Molds; Organic carbon; Pollution control; Seed; Soils; Clean environment; Cleaner production; Climate smart implement; Energy use; Global warming potential; Primary tillages; Agricultural machinery","Pratibha, G.; Central Research Institute drylands AgricultureIndia; email: pratibhaagro65@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Box 1041–00621, Nairobi, Kenya","Long-term changes in average temperatures, precipitation, and climate variability threaten agricultural production, food security, and the livelihoods of farming communities globally. Whilst adaptation to climate change is necessary to ensure food security and protect livelihoods of poor farmers, mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions can lessen the extent of climate change and future needs for adaptation. Many agricultural practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions without compromising food production. India is the third largest GHG emitter in the world where agriculture is responsible for 18% of total national emissions. India has identified agriculture as one of the priority sectors for GHG emission reduction in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). Identification of emission hotspots and cost-effective mitigation options in agriculture can inform the prioritisation of efforts to reduce emissions without compromising food and nutrition security. We adopted a bottom-up approach to analyse GHG emissions using large datasets of India's ‘cost of cultivation survey’ and the ‘19th livestock census’ together with soil, climate and management data for each location. Mitigation measures and associated costs and benefits of adoption, derived from a variety of sources including the literature, stakeholder meetings and expert opinion, were presented in the form of Marginal Abatement Cost Curves (MACC). We estimated that by 2030, business-as-usual GHG emissions from the agricultural sector in India would be 515 Megatonne CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) per year with a technical mitigation potential of 85.5 MtCO2e per year through adoption of various mitigation practices. About 80% of the technical mitigation potential could be achieved by adopting only cost-saving measures. Three mitigation options, i.e. efficient use of fertilizer, zero-tillage and rice-water management, could deliver more than 50% of the total technical abatement potential. © 2018 The Authors","Agriculture; Climate change; Greenhouse gas; India; Marginal Abatement Cost Curve; Mitigation","Agriculture; Cost effectiveness; Cultivation; Emission control; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Surveys; Water management; Adaptation to climate changes; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Climate change mitigation; Cost effective opportunity; India; Marginal abatement cost curves; Mitigation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; abatement cost; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; agriculture; animal husbandry; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; cost control; cost effectiveness analysis; crop production; ecosystem restoration; environmental policy; food security; Gossypium; human; India; land use; livestock; no tillage; nonhuman; priority journal; rice; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; soil management; spatial analysis; sugarcane; water management; wheat; India","Sapkota, T.B.; International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), NASC complex, India; email: t.sapkota@cgiar.org",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"30577126","English","Sci.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has established mitigation and adaptation as strategies to deal with climate change. However, few studies have been developed jointly. With the purpose of studying the possible synergies between mitigation and adaptation, three coffee production systems in the municipality of Líbano: agroforestry systems (AFS) with Cordia allidora, AFS with plantain and monocultures, with four replications by treatment, were evaluated. As mitigation indicator, the carbon footprint in the coffee production and processing was estimated, whereas the adaptation was measured as the ant diversity. The AFS with C. alliodora favor both mitigation and adaptation to climate change since they have a positive carbon footprint and the greatest richness of ant genus (12.8 vs-3.0 vs-6.4 Mg CO 2 e/ha/year in carbon footprint and 1.3 vs 0.6 vs 0.6 of Margalef Index of ants in AFS with C. alliodora, AFS with plantain and monoculture, respectively). The agricultural production systems, environmental-friendly managed and associated with native trees, are a good strategy to implement in programs of mitigation-adaptation of climate change. The inclusion of native tree favors the producer’s economy and increases the shelter places and the minimal conditions for surviving, similar to natural ecosystems so the different groups of animals for climate change adaptation. © 2019, Universidad de Costa Rica.

Specifically, agriculture has increasingly become a key sector for adaptation and mitigation initiatives that address climate change and help ensure food security for a growing global population. Climate change and agricultural outcomes influence our ability to reach targets for at least seven of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals. By 2015, 103 nations had committed themselves to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, while 102 countries had prioritized agriculture in their adaptation agenda. Adaptation and mitigation actions within agriculture still receive insufficient support across scales, from local to international level. This paper reviews a series of climate change adaptation and mitigation options that can support increased production, production efficiency and greater food security for 9 billion people by 2050. Climate-smart agriculture can help foster synergies between productivity, adaptation, and mitigation, although trade-offs may be equally apparent. This study highlights the importance of identifying and exploiting those synergies in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions. Finally, the paper points out that keeping global warming to 2 °C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 requires going beyond the agriculture sector and exploring possibilities with respect to reduced emissions from deforestation, food loss, and waste, as well as from rethinking human diets. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate-smart agriculture; Family farms; Food systems; Greenhouse gas emissions; Mitigation; Small farms","adaptive management; agriculture; climate change; emission; family farm; food security; greenhouse gas; mitigation; prioritization; sustainable development; trade-off","Loboguerrero, A.M.; CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Km. 17, Recta Cali-Palmira, Colombia; email: a.m.loboguerrero@cgiar.org",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062880631

The results show that the impact on the property market of the public's response to the negative impact of cyclones is more marked than its response to the negative impact of beach erosion. The relative non-responsiveness to beach erosion can be seen as a product of both local government intervention strategies and the recreational and aesthetic attractions of beaches.

The information system includes environmental and economic data, linkages between land use activities, their co-benefits, inputs to the economy and benefits for human well-being. Forest management was used as an example of application of the accounting framework because it has the greatest climate change mitigation potential of all land use activities. A case study developing carbon accounts for a forest region in south-eastern Australia demonstrated the mitigation benefits of long-term carbon storage and sequestration in native forests. Using environmental-economic accounts helped identify policy and market instruments required to value ecosystem services of carbon storage and sequestration by applying a potential market price for carbon. We identified benefits of native forest protection as a carbon abatement activity, and compared this value to that of current forest management for timber harvesting that reduces carbon stocks. Both land uses provided similar economic contributions (approximately $12 million yr −1 , using a minimal carbon price), but native forest protection has additional co-benefits of improving water yield, tourism, recreation and biodiversity conservation. The accounts determine values of land use activities in physical and monetary metrics, and link these to beneficiaries of ecosystem services, so that maximum benefits for public good are identified. Quantifying ecosystem services of carbon storage (protecting stocks) and sequestration (increasing flows) in a native forest region, by applying a potential market price, broadens the policy options for mitigation activities. Adopting a comprehensive accounting system, and changing some of the definitions and rules under the Paris Agreement and national emissions reduction policies and markets, would allow the mitigation benefit of protecting native forests to be realised. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; Carbon storage and sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental-economic accounting; Forest management","accounting; Article; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; combustion; comparative study; conservation biology; decomposition; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental protection; forest management; harvesting; land use; logging; plantation; priority journal; recreation; tourism","Keith, H.; Fenner School of Environment and Society, Building 141 Linnaeus Way, Australia; email: Heather.Keith@anu.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

In the context of this paper, EFTs can be defined as solutions for the use of land resources aiming the increasing of goods for meeting the changing human needs and with neutral or positive environmental impact. Changes in the political regime have always had a visible impact on the EFTs issue in Romania. EFTs has gone through several major phases. The political impact on EFTs implementation mainly affected sustainable land management (SLM) and to a small extent, at the end of the communist era and partly during the capitalist period, climate change mitigation. Throughout history, the political factor has dominated and influenced the capacity of the EFTs implementation process in responding to socio-economic stimuli. In addition, quality of life, rural-urban and urban-rural migrations, poverty, education level, and climate change adaptation have had impacts on the status of EFTs according to governance and political reflections. The agrarian reforms from the last two centuries, based on socio-economic demands, have strongly influenced the capacity to implement EFTs both positively and negatively. However, the cultural factor was least affected by political and socio-economic changes as a stability factor in ensuring continued implementation of the EFTs. Currently, there is a strong need to reconsider EFTs as sustainability tools for Romanian agriculture that can cope with climate change and sustainable land management (SLM) demands. This paper presents a brief history of EFTs in Romania and their benefits in achieving SLM equilibrium, describing the impacts of political decisions, socio-economic measures, and cultural features on implementing ETFs policies. © 2018","Environmental friendly techniques; Historical evolution; Political changes; Romanian traditions; Socio-economic measures","Environmental impact; History; Land use; Sustainable development; Environmental-friendly; Historical evolutions; Political changes; Romanians; Socio-economics; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; cultural tradition; environmental impact; implementation process; land management; policy implementation; political change; socioeconomic conditions; sustainability; agricultural worker; article; climate change; cultural factor; education; environmental impact; human; human experiment; human needs; politics; poverty; quality of life; Romania; stimulus; Romania","Hălbac-Cotoară-Zamfir, R.; Department of Overland Communication Ways, Ioan Curea 1A, Romania; email: raresh_81@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"30447580","English","Sci.

Wind power is of particular interest because Taiwan’s maritime climate and constant monsoons make it a feasible alternative that potentially generate a considerable amount of electricity. To better understand how wind power can provide stable electricity output and sequester CO 2 emissions, this study employs the Weibull distribution with a threshold regression model to estimate the electricity potential for 370 scheduled wind farm sites and refine electricity estimation according to observed data from all existing wind farms. The results show that, compared to the theoretical estimation models, our proposed refinement method can, in average, reduce estimating error by 87%. The results indicate that construction of all scheduled sites are not a cost-effective approach, and the government may focus on construction of stations that can generate electricity of more than 12 million kWh per year, if capital rationing do exist. Our insightful results thus convey constructive suggestions regarding sites selection, stability of wind speed, and electricity potential of each site, all of which can be helpful in decision making. It is also noteworthy to point out that unless future climate is far deviated from the observed data, wind power can be an effective substitute of nuclear power. © The Author(s) 2018.","Emission offset; renewable energy; sustainability; threshold regression; Weibull distribution","Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Regression analysis; Site selection; Sustainable development; Weibull distribution; Wind effects; Wind power; Climate change mitigation; Cost-effective approach; Emission offsets; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Theoretical estimation; Threshold regression models; Threshold regressions; Climate change; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; electricity supply; regression analysis; renewable resource; sustainability; Weibull theory; wind power; Taiwan","Lee, T.-J.; Department of Information Management at National Penghu, Taiwan; email: freeman.tj.lee@gms.npu.edu.tw",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",0958305X,,EENVE,,"English","Energy Environ.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052244689

Study findings indicate that building renovations have significant potential for the mitigation of urban-related emissions and achieving the sustainability goals set. However, these measures should be adapted to different climate conditions and different segments of the building stock. In developed countries, where the majority of the building stock is older than 50 years, more effort should be invested into creating adequate policies for the renovation of existing building stock. In developing countries with rapid growth in the urban environment, due to a previous lack of energy-efficiency policies, the focus should be on policy development and an increase in environmental awareness among building owners/tenants.

Bosnia and Herzegovina became a member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) on December 6, 2000. In its status as non-Annex I country within the UNFCCC, Bosnia and Herzegovina is obliged to undertake the following reporting activities, such as: to calculate annual emissions of greenhouse gases using a defined methodology and reporting to the Conference of the Parties (COP), introduce and implement measures to mitigate the effects of climate change by regulating anthropogenic emissions and adaptation measures to climate change. Also cooperates in the development and transfer of technology, methods and processes that lead to limitation, reduction and stabilization of greenhouse gas emissions, include an impact assessment of climate change and appropriate economic development strategies and policies aimed at minimizing the negative impacts of climate change on the economy, the environment and the health of the population; conduct systematic observation and research, exchange data and exchange information on climate and climate change in order to improve scientific discoveries on the causes and consequences of climate change. This project not only supports the country of Bosnia and Herzegovina in fulfilling the above obligations as a signatory to the UNFCCC, but will also serve as an important strategic document for sustainable development. Also, this project promotes relations between entities and business sectors, establishing links between the environment and other sectors. The data on the emission of F-gases in Bosnia and Herzegovina, including sources of these gases, are provided. In this paper, potentially intrusive measures are suggested. Ozone is a gas located in the earth's atmosphere in a layer of 15 to 35 km above the Earth and has a special significance for the planets and the entire life on it. It is very important his role for the protection of life on Earth, and the disrupted occurrences of ozone flows through the atmosphere can have harmful effects on the health of man and the environment as a whole. The amount of ozone in the tropospheric (in the first lower layer above the Earth) and the tratospheric (upper-upper layer) was in the past in a natural balance. Uncontrolled human activity, in particular the development of the refrigeration industry, and the accelerated increase in the emissions of individual industrial gases, there was an increase in ozone levels in the tropospheric layer and in the stratospheric reduction. Concentration of ozone in the stratosphere and troposphere is limited by the balance between the chemical processes produced by ozone and the processes that destroy it. This equilibrium of the process is determined and depends on the amount of gases (involved in the reaction) and the speed (or efficiency of individual reactions), depending on the intensity of sunlight, location and area in the atmosphere, temperature and other natural climate factors. Global ozone has declined steadily over the last few decades. The Earth's stratosphere has increased the amount of reactive gases, containing chlorine and bromine. The biggest impact on climate change is the carbon dioxide emission CO2, due to the far-reaching emissions (measured in billions of tonnes per year). Among the ""greenhouse gases"" with the far-reaching ""global warming potential"" (GWP) are the so-called ""Ozone gases"" or substances that damage the ozone layer CFC and HCFC. Fortunately, there is a far smaller amount of these gases that reaches the atmosphere than CO2. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

(2017) presented greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the production of major food commodities in India. Emissions of GHGs were calculated using the Cool Farm Tool and were based on farm management data for major crops (including cereals like wheat and rice, pulses, potatoes, fruits and vegetables) and livestock-based products (milk, eggs, chicken and mutton meat). Methods correction We corrected the calculated emissions by fixing errors in the model script and refined the methodological approach to accommodate the fixes. The correction included (i) fixing an error in application of the Stehfest and Bouwman (2006) model for calculating the N2O emissions, (ii) fixing a double counting of methane emissions for rice per kg production, (iii) excluding data points for plots with zero recorded yield (to avoid division by zero in carbon footprints), (iv) choosing appropriate crop classes for cotton and sugarcane, and (v) fix the percentage of rice under flooding conditions as previously it was not representative of the area under this management. Livestock emissions were revised after additional discussion with livestock experts. The new feed emissions were based on the amended GHG emissions of the crops, and the GHG emissions from enteric fermentation and manure were adjusted to match the Indian dataset in Herrero et al. 2013. For each crop and livestock species, weighted average emissions were calculated considering state-level total area under crop obtained from the Directorate of Economics and Statistics of the Government of India (http://eands.dacnet.nic.in) and total number of animals obtained from the 19th livestock census of the Government of India (GOI, 2012). Results update GHG emissions of food items up to farm-gate The updated results are given in Table 1 and Fig. 2. For paddy rice, &gt;10,000 plots were available for analysis with a wide range of management practices, which is reflected in the GHG emission results (Fig. 2B). The main reason for the wide range in GHG emissions seen in rice was water management, the main determinant of CH4 emissions. In particular, continuous flooding generated the highest CH4 emissions, while longer and more frequent periods of drying reduced emissions. For example, changing the water regime from continuously flooded to multiple drying of the field, reduced CH4 emissions 9-fold (data not shown). The GHG emissions weighted by state level area gave a value of 2408 kg ha-1. Emissions of GHGs per kg product i.e. GHG emission intensity (Fig. 2C) varied markedly between livestock types. Emissions were highest for mutton meat (as the example for ruminant meat), followed by other livestock products such as dairy (milk) and poultry products (eggs, poultry meat). Emissions intensities were greater for livestock products than for crops. Mean GHG emissions were &lt;0.8 kg CO2eq kg-1 product for all crops. The intensity of GHG emissions among crops was greatest in rice (0.73 kg CO2eq kg-1), followed by the group of other pulses. Greater GHG emissions intensity in pulses was mainly because of lower yield compared to other crop items. Intensities of GHG emissions from other crop groups were lower in the order of pulses, nuts and oils, cereals, fruits, roots and vegetables. GHG emissions from food consumption in India Fig. 3 A shows relative reported consumption by weight of commodities in the Indian Migration Study (IMS), while 3B shows their relative contribution to emissions. Livestock products other than ruminant meat (principally milk, poultry and eggs) contributed the most to total dietary GHG emissions. Although ruminant meat had the greatest GHG emissions per unit product, it contributed less to overall GHG emissions (21.7%) as consumption was low, accounting for only 0.4% of the mass of total food intake. Rice was the third largest contributor to total emissions (9.4%). Cereals other than rice and fruit products accounted for 12.9% and 22.5% of reported consumption by weight, respectively, yet as their emissions per unit of product were low, they made a relatively small contribution to total dietary GHG emissions, representing only 5.3% and 2% of total emissions, respectively. The groups “other” (including various crops from the subgroups nuts and oils, spices, and vegetables), potato and pulses also contributed little to total dietary GHG emissions compared to livestock. Amended discussion GHG emissions from livestock products Emissions of GHGs associated with livestock products depended largely on feed inputs, and in other studies had been shown to range between 0.8–2.4 kg CO2eq kg-1 milk, 1.7–6.6 kg CO2eq kg-1 eggs, 2.5–6.9 kg CO2eq kg-1 poultry meat and 10–20 kg CO2eq kg-1 mutton and lamb (Bellarby et al., 2013). Most of these values came from model-based studies which focused on Europe. Our results for milk in India were within the range of these studies. The calculated emissions of poultry products were lower than in the above studies, but gave similar results to those reported by Pathak et al. (2010). The GHG emissions for mutton were greater, resulting from embedded emissions in feed, which were 50–75% of the total GHG emissions per-animal-per-year. GHG emissions associated with Indian diets Overall, national GHG emissions associated with diets were greatest for livestock products such as milk and eggs (Fig. 3), because these were widely consumed products with high GHG emissions per unit of product.

It also reviews the mitigation and adaptations undertaken, and future strategies to manage the impacts of regional climate change. Methodology: The review encompasses historical climate data comprising mean daily temperature, precipitation, mean sea level and occurrences of extreme weather events. Future climate projections have also been reviewed in addition to scholarly papers and news articles related to impacts, contributors, mitigation and adaptations in relation to climate change. Findings: The review shows that annual mean temperature, occurrences of extreme weather events and mean sea level are rising while rainfall shows variability. Future projections point to continuous rise of temperature and mean sea level till the end of the 21st century, highly variable rainfall and increased frequency of extreme weather events. Climate change impacts particularly on agriculture, forestry, biodiversity, water resources, coastal and marine resources, public health and energy. The energy and waste management sectors are the major contributors to climate change. Mitigation of and adaptations to climate change in Malaysia revolve around policy setting, enactment of laws, formulation and implementation of plans and programmes, as well as global and regional collaborations, particularly for energy, water resources, agriculture and biodiversity. There are apparent shortcomings in continuous improvement and monitoring of the programmes as well as enforcement of the relevant laws. Originality/value: This paper presents a comprehensive review of the major themes of climate change in Malaysia and recommends pertinent ways forward to fill the gaps of mitigation and adaptations already implemented. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Climate change; Impacts; Malaysia; Mitigation; Trends","Biodiversity; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Marine biology; Rain; Regional planning; Sea level; Waste management; Water resources; Weather information services; Adaptation; Impacts; Malaysia; Mitigation; Trends; Climate change; rain; adaptive management; air temperature; climate change; climate effect; extreme event; greenhouse gas; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; sea level; trend analysis; agriculture; biodiversity; climate change; coastal waters; energy resource; environmental impact; environmental policy; environmental temperature; evolutionary adaptation; forestry; greenhouse gas; Malaysia; priority journal; public health; Review; sea level; waste management; water supply; Malaysia",,,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"30290336","English","Sci.

We focus on countries that hold 80% of global fossil fuel reserves and compare them with key countries that have meagre fossil fuel reserves. We show that those countries with large domestic fossil fuel reserves have experienced a large increase in primary energy demand from fossil fuels, but only a moderate or no increase in primary energy from renewables, and in particular from non-hydro renewable energy sources (NHRES), which are assumed to represent the cornerstone of the future transformation of the global energy system. This implies a tremendous threat to climate change mitigation, with only two principal mitigation options for fossil-fuel-rich economies if there is to be compliance with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement: (1) leave the fossil fuels in the ground; and (2) apply carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies. Combinations of these two options to exploit their respective possibilities synergistically will require strong initiatives and incentives to transform a certain amount of the domestic fossil fuel reserves (including the associated infrastructure) into stranded assets and to create an extensive CCS infrastructure. Our conclusion is that immediate and disruptive changes to the use of fossil fuels and investments in non-carbon-emitting technologies are required if global warming is to be limited to well below 2°C. Collective actions along value chains in business to divert from fossil fuels may be a feasible strategy. Key policy insights The main obstacle to compliance with any reasonable warming target is the abundance of fossil fuels, which has maintained and increased momentum towards new fossil-fuelled processes. So far, there has been no increase in the share of NHRES in total global primary energy demand, with a clear decline in the NHRES share in India and China. There is an immediate need for the global community to develop fossil fuel strategies and policies. Policies must account for the global trade flow of products that typically occurs from the newly industrialized fossil fuel-rich countries to the developed countries. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

A number of tools and approaches exist, which aim to help manage these challenges and support long-term decision making. However, most tools and approaches assume that there is one decision maker with clearly defined objectives. The interaction between decision makers with differing perspectives and agency is an additional uncertainty that is rarely addressed, despite the wide recognition that action is required at multiple scales and by multiple actors. This article draws inspiration from dynamic adaptive policy pathways to build on current decision support methods, extending analysis to include the perspectives and agency of multiple actors through a case study of the UK construction sector. The findings demonstrate the importance of considering alignment between perspectives, agency and potential actions when developing plans; the need for mobilizing and advocacy actions to build momentum for radical change; and the crucial influence of interaction between actors. The decision support approach presented could improve decision making by reflecting the diversity and interaction of actors; identifying short-term actions that connect to long-term goals and keeping future options open. Key policy insights Multiple actors, with differing motivations, agency and influence, must engage with climate change mitigation, but may not do so, if proposed actions do not align with their motivations or if they do not have agency to undertake specific actions. Current roadmaps, which assume there is one decision maker with control over a whole system, might overstate how effective proposed actions could be. Decision making under deep uncertainty needs to account for the motivations and agency of diverse decision makers and the interaction between these decision makers. This could increase the implementation and effectiveness of mitigation activities. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Egg-burying reptiles that exhibit temperature-dependent sex determination, such as critically endangered hawksbill turtles (Eretmochelys imbricata), are particularly vulnerable to changes in thermal regimes because nest temperatures affect offspring sex, fitness, and survival. It is unclear whether hawksbills possess sufficient behavioral plasticity of nesting traits (i.e., redistribution of nesting range, shift in nesting phenology, changes in nest-site selection, and adjustment of nest depth) to persist within their climatic niche or whether accelerated changes in thermal conditions of nesting beaches will outpace phenotypic adaption and require human intervention. For these reasons, we estimated sex ratios and physical condition of hatchling hawksbills under natural and manipulated conditions and generated and analyzed thermal profiles of hawksbill nest environments within highly threatened mangrove ecosystems at Bahía de Jiquilisco, El Salvador, and Estero Padre Ramos, Nicaragua. Hawksbill clutches protected in situ at both sites incubated at higher temperatures, yielded lower hatching success, produced a higher percentage of female hatchlings, and produced less fit offspring than clutches relocated to hatcheries. We detected cooler sand temperatures in woody vegetation (i.e., coastal forest and small-scale plantations of fruit trees) and hatcheries than in other monitored nest environments, with higher temperatures at the deeper depth. Our findings indicate that mangrove ecosystems present a number of biophysical (e.g., insular nesting beaches and shallow water table) and human-induced (e.g., physical barriers and deforestation) constraints that, when coupled with the unique life history of hawksbills in this region, may limit behavioral compensatory responses by the species to projected temperature increases at nesting beaches. We contend that egg relocation can contribute significantly to recovery efforts in a changing climate under appropriate circumstances. © 2019 The Authors.

Many studies have investigated the impact of summer temperature on human health and have proposed mitigation strategies for summer heat waves. However, sub-tropical cities are still experiencing winter temperature variations. Increasing winter perceived temperature through the decades may soon affect city wellbeing, due to a larger temperature change between normal winter days and extreme cold events, which may cause higher health risk due to lack of adaptation and self-preparedness. Therefore, winter perceived temperature should also be considered and integrated in urban sustainable planning. This study has integrated the increasing winter perceived temperature as a factor for developing spatiotemporal protocols for mitigating the adverse impact of climate change. Land surface temperature (LST) derived from satellite images and building data extracted from aerial photographs were used to simulate the adjusted wind chill equivalent temperature (AWCET) particularly for sub-tropical scenarios between 1990 and 2010 of the Kowloon Peninsula, Hong Kong. Compared with perceived temperature based on the representative station located at the headquarters of the Hong Kong Observatory, the temperature of half the study area in the Kowloon Peninsula has raised by 1.5◦C. The areas with less green space and less public open space in 2010 show higher relative temperatures. Socioeconomically deprived areas (e.g., areas with lower median monthly income) may suffer more from this scenario, but not all types of socioeconomic disparities are associated with poor sustainable planning. Based on our results and the “no-one left behind” guideline from the United Nations, climate change mitigation should be conducted by targeting socioeconomic neighborhoods more than just aging communities. © 2019 by the authors.

Concurrently, climate change has also been a major challenge for countries around the world. Energy systems are dominant emission sources of both PM2.5 and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ). This study investigates cost-efficient energy system transitions for individual or dual targets of climate change mitigation and PM2.5 concentration reduction by a global energy systems model. We set two levels of mitigation efforts for each of the CO 2 and PM2.5 emissions, whose stringent one corresponds to the long-term target of the Paris agreement and current national air quality standards, respectively. For PM2.5 reduction, a combination of moderate improvement in energy efficiency and a transition from coal to gas and renewable energies and a significant deployment of end-of-pipe measures for scrubbing air pollutants is shown to be among the most cost-efficient strategy. For CO 2 reduction, drastic improvement in energy efficiency and a rapid transition from coal to gas, renewable and nuclear energies is the most cost-efficient strategy, in contrast. There is a larger co-benefit on PM2.5 concentration reduction from CO 2 reduction measures than the converse, and the co-benefit varies regionally. Developing countries such as India have a huge potential of co-benefits, and energy efficiency improvement and fuel switching are key measures to bring them.

Considering Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure database as the basic retrieval source, this paper presents the status and hot spots reported in studies on the carbon emissions of the coal mining industry. The results reveal that the scientific outcomes of these studies in this field have increased sharply in the last 5 years. China University of Mining and Technology and the China Coal Research Institute are outstanding research institutes regarding this research topic. The subject distribution suggested the studies on the carbon emissions of the coal mining sector have developed into an interdisciplinary field, which includes the coal mining technology, industrial economy, management and environment. The related hot spots indicate that the energy consumed during the mining process, coal mine gas, sustainable plans for abandoned coal mines and utilization of coal gangue are the indexes for low-carbon development of the coal mining industry, which is also significant for mine disaster prevention. It should be highlighted that the coal spontaneous combustion during the coal mining process and the coal production structure represented by the number of coal mines and the minimum capacity requirement could be important factors for achieving future carbon emission reductions in the coal mining sector. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Bibliometric analysis; Carbon emissions; Coal mine gas; Coal mining; Low-carbon development","carbon; climate change; coal mine; coal mining; coal production; gangue; safety","Wang, B.; Beijing Key Laboratory for Precise Mining of Intergrown Energy and Resources, China; email: bingwang_bit@163.com",,"Springer Netherlands",0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.

Design/methodology/approach: Using a qualitative approach to data collection, the paper draws upon information collected from relevant literature and interviews with 18 key country resource personnel. Findings: Results revealed that most reviewed policies/programs/strategies do not mention “climate change” explicitly but propose some activities which indirectly address it. Interaction is fair within the government ministries but weak between these ministries and other institutions. Inadequate financial resources are being opined as the most important challenge stakeholders are (and would continue) facing as a result of adopting integrated approaches to climate change. Other challenges include inadequate coordination, insufficient sensitization and capacity building, ineffective implementation, inadequate compliance, lack of proper transparency and inadequate public participation. To redress the aforementioned constraints and challenges, the paper concludes by outlining a number of recommendations for policy design. Originality/value: The following recommendations were made: create a national technical committee to oversee and provide scientific guidance to the government on synergistic approaches; promote private sector investment and sponsorship on synergistic approaches; create local awareness, etc. It is important to underscore that minimal studies have been conducted to analyze multi-stakeholder perspectives on synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation in Cameroon.

The energy sector is also a large consumer of water, making water efficiency targets ingrained in SDG6 important constraints for long-term energy planning. Here, we apply a global integrated assessment model to quantify the cost and characteristics of infrastructure pathways balancing SDG6 targets for water access, scarcity, treatment and efficiency with long-term energy transformations limiting climate warming to 1.5 °C. Under a mid-range human development scenario, we find that approximately 1 trillion USD2010 per year is required to close water infrastructure gaps and operate water systems consistent with achieving SDG6 goals by 2030. Adding a 1.5 °C climate policy constraint increases these costs by up to 8%. In the reverse direction, when the SDG6 targets are added on top of the 1.5 °C policy constraint, the cost to transform and operate energy systems increases 2%-9% relative to a baseline 1.5 °C scenario that does not achieve the SDG6 targets by 2030. Cost increases in the SDG6 pathways are due to expanded use of energy-intensive water treatment and costs associated with water conservation measures in power generation, municipal, manufacturing and agricultural sectors. Combined global spending (capital and operational expenditures) to 2030 on water, energy and land systems increases 92%-125% in the integrated SDG6-1.5 °C scenarios relative to a baseline 'no policy' scenario. Evaluation of the multi-sectoral policies underscores the importance of water conservation and integrated water-energy planning for avoiding costs from interacting water, energy and climate goals. © 2019 The Author(s).

This special volume (SV) provides a platform that promotes multi- and inter- disciplinary analyses and discussions on the climate change mitigation for cities. All papers are divided into four themes, including GHG emission inventory and accounting, climate change and urban sectors, climate change and sustainable development, and strategies and mitigation action plans. First, this SV provides methods for constructing emission inventory from both production and consumption perspectives. These methods are useful to improve the comprehensiveness and accuracy of carbon accounting for international cities. Second, the climate change affects urban sectors from various aspects; simultaneously, GHG emissions caused by activities in urban sectors affect the climate system. This SV focuses on mitigation policies and assessment of energy, transport, construction, and service sectors. Third, climate change mitigation of cities is closely connected to urban sustainable development. This SV explores the relationships between climate change mitigation with urbanization, ecosystems, air pollution, and extreme events. Fourth, climate change mitigation policies can be divided into two categories: quantity-based mechanism (e.g., carbon emission trading) and price-based mechanism (e.g., carbon tax). This SV provides experiences of local climate change mitigation all over the world and proposes the city-to-city cooperation on climate change mitigation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","City; Climate change; Emission inventory; Mitigation; Sustainable development","Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental protection; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Sustainable development; Carbon emission trading; City; Climate change mitigation; Emission inventories; Low-carbon development; Mitigation; Production and consumption; Urban sustainable development; Climate change","Mi, Z.; The Bartlett School of Construction and Project Management, United Kingdom; email: z.mi@ucl.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

The author interviewed policy makers, grassroots leaders and the citizens and found that this interaction between the government (top-down) and the citizens (bottom-up) is sorely missing, which results in a disjoint between what the government wants citizens to know and what the citizens actually know. Without this interaction, climate change education policy will not be successful. The proposed Grassroots Approach (GRA) framework that emerged from the qualitative inquiry describes how climate change education policy can be implemented in the context of societies like Singapore through an integration of the top-down and bottom-up approaches. The 6 stages of the GRA enable policy to be formulated, to provide information to the public, to obtain consultation, to encourage involvement, to garner feedback and to seek advisory, with regards to climate change. The findings not only show an update in its current policy but also an indication of the adoption of GRA in implementing new campaigns and initiatives. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","bottom-up approach; climate change; climate change education policy; Grassroots organisations; Singapore; top-down approach","bottom-up approach; climate change; education; education policy; government; grassroots level; local participation; mitigation; policy implementation; policy making; top-down approach; Singapore [Southeast Asia]","Wi, A.; Office of Graduate Studies and Professional Learning, Singapore; email: andy.wi@nie.edu.sg",,"Routledge",10382046,,,,"English","Int.

And in the process enable them to contribute to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in these developing countries, while reaping economic rewards for doing so. ‘Green capitalism’ as a concept merges economic capitalism with green objectives and when appropriately utilised, can be an effective tool for achieving the SDGs in developing countries. This chapter analyses the application of green capitalism in developing countries and how it merges the profit-focus of capitalism with environmental sustainability. Utilising the ‘environment contestation approach’, the chapter examines how ‘green capitalism’ reconciles the notions of free-market enterprise and the sustainable development desired by developing countries. It discusses the regulatory steps needed to prevent potential ‘greenwashing’ by corporations while incentivising increased investments in SDGs-related projects within these jurisdictions. Using available statistics, the chapter examines the success of ‘green bonds’ issuance for environmental projects as a reflection of the increasing reliance on green capitalist tools for achieving the SDGs in developing countries. © Cambridge University Press 2020.",,,"Kila, K.; University of ExeterUnited Kingdom",,"Cambridge University Press",,9781108579360; 9781108472111,,,"English","Corporate Social Responsibility in Developing and Emerg.

Duara's thesis was counterattacked by scientists and religionists who stated that religion has the spirit and teachings of careness for the environment. Nevertheless, the arguments they built are still theological, normative and theoretical. This study is an antithesis to the Duara's statement and at the same time presents evidence based on the primary data that occurred in three Sufi communities. The focus of this study analyzes Sufi activism in Indonesia in safeguarding the earth, as a form of substantial religious responses to the environmental crisis due to climate change. Through the principles and mechanism of qualitative research methods, researchers sought to analyze mitigation and adaptation actions to climate change carried out by the Majlis Zikir Kraton Pekalongan, Jamaah Aoulia Panggang and Pesan Trend Ilmu Giri. The data are obtained through interviews, observation and documentation and they are analyzed interactively. The results of the study revealed that climate change is believed by the Sufis as God's authority due to human destructive behavior. For Sufis, overcoming climate change must begin with a change in the perspective of human relations, nature and God. In the case of three Sufi communities, religion is not just a doctrine of the relationship between God and humans, but also operational guidance on how to synergize with nature. Through a substantial religious spirit, the Sufis guard the earth through the re-actualization of the narratives of takhalli, tahalli and tajalli, as ecological repentance, ecological movements, and ecological campaigns in mitigating and adapting to climate change. [Prasenjet Duara (2015) menuduh agama-agama samawi sebagai penyebab terjadinya krisis lingkungan dan bencana alam.

In this perspective, the agriculture sector is facing a wide rethinking on the way to better integrate environment and climate change issues into agriculture policies. Schools of thinking towards sustainable agriculture and agroecology are competing with new concepts such as sustainable land management, climate-smart agriculture and low-carbon agriculture. On the other hand, policymakers and donors face the issue of integration of mitigation and adaptation in agriculture policies and investment programmes. New performance indicators such as carbon footprint and carbon balance are used to select value and promote high-performing options. Similarly, food markets progressively provide products with reduced carbon footprint. Implementing such new and marketing mechanisms slowly induce a progressive transformation of the food value chains, agriculture policies and incentives. However, high inertia does remain in the agricultural sector, slowing down the switch towards real low-carbon agriculture options. This chapter does analyse a series of shortcuts used by countries and donors to stimulate such structural change, considering appropriate appraising tools, new incentive mechanisms, new modalities of funding and acting with scaling-up perspectives. Agroforestry value chains upgrading scenarios such as cocoa or shea parkland restoration are provided as examples of upscaling paths with high-carbon-fixing performances.The issues covered in this chapter include “environmental policy”, “sustainable agriculture”, “climate-smart agriculture”, “climate mitigation and adaptation”, “global food policy” and “low-carbon agriculture”. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Agriculture policy; Carbon footprint; Ex-act tool; Low-carbon agriculture; Sustainable development goals; Value chains",,"Bockel, L.; Regional Office for AfricaGhana; email: Louis.Bockel@fao.org",,"Springer Singapore",,9789811395703; 9789811395697,,,"English","Global Climate Change and Environmental Policy: Agriculture Perspectives",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085815885

During the recent decades, Himalaya has experienced rapid urbanization mainly in response to population growth, improved road connectivity, development of tourism and economic globalization. As a result, urbanization has emerged as one of the important drivers of land use and environmental changes depleting natural resources and biodiversity, and disrupting natural drainage and ecosystem services; and increasing vulnerability of anthropogenically modified slopes to a variety of natural risks, particularly under climate change. The paper analyzes the emerging threats of unplanned urban growth in the densely populated Middle Himalayan Ranges with a case illustration of Nainital Town located in Uttarakhand. It was observed that the rapid urbanization is increasing the susceptibility of intensively modified and densely populated fragile slopes to the active processes of mass movement and landslides. Moreover, the rapidly changing climatic conditions, particularly the climate change induced hydrological extremes are posing severe threats to the sustainability of fast-growing urban ecosystem by increasing the frequency, intensity and severity of geo-hydrological hazards in the town and its surrounding region. The city development plan and also the state disaster risk reduction framework and climate change adaptation plan did not make any provision for addressing the emerging risks of climate change in Nainital and other towns of Uttarakhand. A comprehensive climate change vulnerability assessment and mapping of the town should be carried taking into account all the critical parameters of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of urban ecosystem involving a range of institutions and stakeholders. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

In addition, current food systems fail to deliver healthy and sustainable foods for all, with obesity as well as undernourishment remaining a pertinent global issue. Mounting pressures such as population growth and urbanisation urge rapid and transformational adaptations in food systems to sustainably feed a growing population. Sustainable diets have been promoted as a potential climate change mitigation strategy, and are characterized by high plant based foods and reduced animal-sourced and processed foods. While the evidence base on the potential health and environmental impacts of shifts towards sustainable diets has been growing rapidly over the past decade, there has been no recent synthesis of the evidence surrounding the health and climate mitigation benefits of sustainable consumption patterns. This systematic review will synthesize the evidence of both empirical and modelling studies assessing the direct health outcomes (such as all-cause mortality and body mass index) as well as environmental impacts (greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water use etc.) of shifts towards sustainable diets. Eight literature databases will be searched to identify studies published between 1999-2019 that report both health and environmental outcomes of sustainable diets.

Agroforestry system may contribute to alleviate the effects of heat stress, by providing thermal comfort to the animals. Specific studies, in fact, demonstrated that the presence of trees and their arrangement in the agroforestry systems provide better microclimate conditions and animal thermal comfort in pastures.

Kaliwlingi, a coastal village in Brebes, lies on the estuary of Pemali River in the north of Java Island, Indonesia. Disaster preparedness and climate change mitigation are one of the five aspects factored in coastal disaster resilience assessment at the village level. This quantitative research was designed to determine the coastal community resilience in Kaliwlingi by analyzing disaster preparedness and climate change mitigation. The variables were grouped into infrastructure and non-infrastructure. While the former consists of early warning systems and physical infrastructure, the latter includes government responsibility and regulations on disaster preparedness. The questionnaire items were encoded to the Likert scale, and then the data were analyzed to understand how the community perceived the prevailing disaster and climate change preparedness. The results showed that the community had substantial knowledge of emergency food stockpiles and proper recognition on shoreline structures and early warning system but poor comprehension of available shelter, emergency actions by the local government, and disaster preparedness. Based on these indicators, this community was concluded as moderately resilient. Also, gender seemed to be the strongest determinant of resilience index. Relative to the male community members, the female had a broader knowledge of disaster preparedness regulation and access to evacuation routes. Although livelihood significantly shaped the resilience index, formal education attainment appeared to have less influence. © 2019 SPIE.","Brebes; Climate change; Coastal; Disaster preparedness; Resilience village","Disaster prevention; Disasters; Rural areas; Brebes; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Coastal; Disaster preparedness; Quantitative research; Resilience village; Shoreline structures; Climate change","Marfai, M.A.; Faculty of Geography, Indonesia; email: arismarfai@ugm.ac.id","Setiawan Y.Prasetyo L.B.Murayama Y.Kanniah K.D.Perez G.J.Dat P.T.","SPIE",0277786X,9781510635159,PSISD,,"English","Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079208876

Methods: An online survey was conducted among residents of California (Los Angeles/Orange), Florida (Miami-Dade/Broward), and Arizona (Maricopa) counties in July 2018 (n=605). Multivariable ordered logistic regression measured associations between the perceived importance of adaptation/mitigation approaches and income, race/ethnicity, and health conditions, controlling for age, political party, and county. Results: Lower income was associated with higher perceived importance of improved emergency alerts, government-subsidized costs of household air conditioners and energy-efficient appliances, strengthening buildings against extreme weather, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, urban planning using ""cooling"" technologies, and expanding community gardens/local agriculture. Black respondents perceived evacuation services for those with financial barriers during extreme weather, government-subsidized costs of energy-efficient appliances, and communication from government agencies about local climate impacts and mitigation as significantly more important compared to non-Black, non-Hispanic respondents. Hispanic respondents perceived significantly greater importance of improved emergency alerts and health care access during extreme weather, evacuation services for residents without transportation, government-subsidized costs of energy-efficient appliances, regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, communication from government agencies about local climate impacts and mitigation efforts, and intergovernmental cooperation on mitigation compared to non-Hispanic respondents.

Miscanthus, also known as elephant grass, is a high yielding grass crop that grows over three metres tall, resembles bamboo and produces a crop every year without the need for replanting or fertiliser application. The rapid growth, low mineral content, and high biomass yield of Miscanthus increasingly make it a favourite choice as a biofuel, outperforming switchgrass and other alternatives. There is over 20 years of research evidence to support its promotion as a second generation biomass crop. The author reviews many field measurements of yields as well as the physiology of the crop, and why it is so productive while at the same time requiring low inputs to grow it. It also shows how as a key biofuel crop it can contribute to mitigating climate change and how uptake of the adoption of Miscanthus production can be promoted, particularly in Europe and North America. The book will be key reading for students taking courses in the areas of Environmental Science and Engineering, Climate Change Impacts, Renewable Energy and Energy Conservation.

The global warming potential (GWP) is assessed in relation to uncertainties in usage of the storage, use-phase energy input, cell replacement, and round-trip efficiency parameters. Relative climate change mitigation potential in comparison with equivalent diesel electric and natural gas generation is discussed, as is the effect of recycling at end of life. With variations in input electricity source, recycling, and efficiency, the life cycle global warming potential for LFP ranges from 185 to 440 kg CO2 eq/MWh, for VRFB from 121 to 443 kg CO2 eq/MWh, and for LAES from 48 to 203 kg CO2 eq/MWh. In all cases, there are climate change mitigation benefits compared to fossil fuel alternatives. Use of renewable energy for charging and operation, ease of component recycling/reuse, and reduced parts replacement is shown to reduce GWP. The climate change mitigation potential of ESS for electricity grid operation is further enhanced by increasing use of the storage assets. Recycling of ESS is shown to reduce terrestrial acidification, freshwater eutrophication, and particulate matter impacts. Reduced ozone depletion potential for VRFB and LFP can be achieved by reducing nafion and PVDF components, respectively. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Eutrophication; Flow batteries; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Iron compounds; Life cycle; Liquefied gases; Lithium batteries; Lithium compounds; Ozone layer; Recycling; Uncertainty analysis; Climate change mitigation; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Lithium iron phosphates; Ozone depletion potential; Stationary energy storages; Use of renewable energies; Vanadium redox flow batteries; Electric energy storage; climate change; electricity; greenhouse effect; recycling; renewable energy; Climate Change; Electricity; Global Warming; Recycling; Renewable Energy","Jones, C.; Tyndall Centre for Climate Change, United Kingdom; email: c.w.jones@manchester.ac.uk",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"31804812","English","Environ.

Egypt is responsible for 0.6 % of the global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Although Egypt is a non-annex I country not requiring any specific emission reduction or limitation targets under the Kyoto protocol, its National plans have included mitigation measures to reduce its greenhouse gases. The main sectors contributing to climate change in Egypt are energy, industry, agriculture and waste. This paper quantifies the biomass resources in Egypt generated from the agriculture sector. The Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Use (AFOLU) sector is responsible for about 10% of national GHG (about 30,043Gg CO2e in 2015). AFOLU sector GHG emissions are mainly generated from 1) enteric fermentation, 2) manure management, 3) rice cultivation, 4) agriculture soil, and 5) field residuals burning. The largest contributor to the total GHG emissions is livestock (55 %) followed by aggregate sources and non-CO2 emissions sources on land (47%). We find that the efforts that Egypt made to contribute to global greenhouse gas emissions reductions through the Kyoto Protocol's clean development mechanism (CDM) to be promising mitigation reductions, which are related to waste management facilities and those which are waste to energy projects.

In addition to hurricanes, Sandy and Irene, are the storms occurring at high tide bringing damaging floods to coastal communities, causing major damage to the historical neighborhoods and developing areas, specifically, new Seaport District. Like other historical ports in the United States, most of Boston, including the new Seaport District, has neighborhoods/commercial districts built on filled coastline. Within recent years, the Seaport District has experienced significant economic increase in businesses/residents. This area has been revived and a thriving community has formed. However, solid mitigation to handle extreme weather and rising seawater is lacking. During the winter storms on 2018 in which the rising sea water flooded neighborhoods, Boston saw the storm surge as a threat to continual development in the Seaport District and around the city. One great storm surge could cause enormous economic damage to the city's coastlines. Several towns in Massachusetts have adopted their own mitigation plans. Boston is researching and exploring the economic and life safety issues to address or prepare for the changing climate. Adopting a formal plan is vital to preserving and protecting Boston's rich history and neighborhoods. This paper addresses mitigation measures to form a robust plan for policy makers, useful recommendations for engineers and designers working on infrastructure/buildings in coastal communities. These mitigation measures include protecting life safety equipment, MEP services/equipment, structural durability, accessibility with flood events, functional design recommendations for at-risk buildings, and retention. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Floods; Ports and harbors; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Sea level; Seawater; Storms; Changing climate; Climate change mitigation; Coastal communities; Economic damages; Economic increase; Functional design; Mitigation measures; Structural durability; Climate change",,"Chester M.V.Norton M.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",,9780784482650,,,"English","Int.

Countries with extreme climate, rapidly growing urban environment, and fossil fuel-based energy systems [for example, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states] would be most susceptible to such impacts. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the increase in building energy demand in GCC countries, driven by climate change, and assess the efficiency of suggested mitigation measures. Moreover, the potential obstacles for the implementation of such measures are examined from an interdisciplinary perspective. The results were obtained by simulating building energy performance for a representative residential building, under reference and forecasted weather conditions for all GCC member states. The findings indicate building energy demand increase of up to 16% and 28% in 2050 and 2080 (respectively). By implementing building envelope renovation as a mitigation measure, future energy demand could be reduced for up to 20%, achieving significant carbon emission savings. However, while such renovation measures proved to be economically and environmentally feasible in developed countries, additional investigation should be performed for GCC countries, taking into account local sociopolitical, environmental, and economic aspects. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","buildings; climate change; policy; renovation","Buildings; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Public policy; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Building energy demands; Building energy performance; Developed countries; Gulf Cooperation Council; Mitigation measures; Outdoor temperature; renovation; Residential building; Climate change",,"Chester M.V.Norton M.","American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE)",,9780784482650,,,"English","Int.

Also, mitigation of climate change in the peatlands agriculture should also be given priority. This paper explores the existing farming action on climate change mitigation, and strategies of degraded peatlands management to mitigate climate change in term of reducing GHG emission. Existing condition of mitigation action by farmers in their farming systems; rice, rubber and oil palm, were reviewed through a farm household survey. Then, development strategies for climate change mitigation through sustainable degraded peatlands management were discussed through Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview with experts from concerned research institutions and universities through morphological analysis. The finding of this research shows that farmer’s existing climate change mitigation actions pertain to land preparation, water management, and soil management in their farming system. Moreover, specific actions and strategies to mitigate climate change in the sustainable degraded peatlands management which were determined based on the most relevant variables under a given future condition consist of constructing canal blocking system, introducing technology for water and soil management, revitalizing agricultural extension institution as well as establishing fire brigade and improving farmer experience and knowledge on climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).","Agriculture; Climate change; Mitigation; Peatlands; Sustainable",,"Surahman, A.; Indonesian Agency for Agricultural Research and DevelopmentIndonesia; email: asrahman72@gmail.com",,"Igitur, Utrecht Publishing and Archiving Services",18750281,,,,"English","Int.

However, these energy technologies are limited mainly by political and economic constraints of high costs and the lack of subsidy. Carbon-pricing strategies, such as carbon-emission taxes and carbon-emission trading schemes, may reduce this gap between sustainable and unsustainable energy technologies. Therefore, this paper seeks to analyze both of these carbon-pricing instruments in the Mexican energy sector to promote upgrading biogas investment and to substitute liquified petroleum gas consumption using an optimization approach. Furthermore, we propose a multi-objective optimization approach to encourage investment in the biogas supply chain supported by an effective use of carbon-pricing schemes. A case study of the central western region of Mexico was made to analyze the performance of the proposed methodologies. The results show that carbon-emission taxes and carbon-emission trading systems stimulate, with some limitations, the investment in biogas projects for fossil fuel substitution. Nevertheless, using the proposed multi-objective optimization formulation leads the discovery of a more efficient use of the above-mentioned carbon-pricing schemes, thus reaching higher economic and environmental benefits than traditional carbon-pricing policies, with a lower cost/price per ton of carbon dioxide equivalent. © 2019 by the authors.","Biogas; Carbon emission trading; Carbon tax; Fossil fuel substitution; Optimization",,"Ponce-Ortega, J.M.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Mexico; email: jmponce@umich.mx",,"MDPI AG",22279717,,,,"English","Process.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074236051

Opportunities and barriers for the use of such tools and whether climate change communication is an enhancing or hindering effect is very important in this investigation. As an example for such a tool, an industrial symbiosis model where an unorthodox regional approach is taken rather than close proximity cooperating companies, has been implemented in the Western Black Sea Region countries. The results of the study include three major barriers; namely, lack of regional policy and relevant legislation, trust among companies and a common working language in the region. The effects of other barriers and possible opportunities that would hinder these barriers are discussed in this study including the lack of regional policies on climate change based on one-to-one interviews with selected company representatives in the region.

Incomplete knowledge and vast challenges in communicating climate change are crucial factors in this problem. In order to increase people’s awareness of their role in climate change, highly specific communication strategies are necessary. Besides insufficient information on group-specific realities of life, existing strategies are often limited by the absence of quantitative data that could give decision makers the opportunity to estimate the potential and evaluate the success of communication measures. In order to meet these requirements, energy use and corresponding emissions must be analysed in relation to behavioural patterns and technology choices of relevant social groups. This perspective leads to a more detailed understanding of how energy use and the responsibility for greenhouse gas emissions are distributed within society. This paper presents an interdisciplinary approach for providing the required knowledge within a single research process and describes its most relevant features as compared to previous methods. We describe the empirical development of an impact based “Energy Lifestyle” typology for the Austrian society and describe the six identified groups in detail with special focus on the challenges that might evolve in group specific communication. Thereafter, we set the six Energy Lifestyles in context with the name-giving concept “Paris Lifestyle” and discuss its role for evaluating the succession towards the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Behaviour; Climate change; Communication; Emissions; Energy use; Impact based; Lifestyle; Policy; Quantification; Target group identification",,"Schwarzinger, S.; Centre for Climate, Waagner-Biro Straße 100, Austria; email: stephan.schwarzinger@joanneum.at",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071440901

Wild Power is a new approach to renewable energy supply that requires native biodiversity to be restored on its generating sites as a core component of the business model. A customer pays a small premium which is used to encourage biodiversity, and in return receives a guarantee of renewable energy supply and biodiversity benefit. Solar farms are the ideal vehicle for delivering biodiversity benefits as the panels oversail the land, most of which is available for ecological enhancement. Furthermore, solar farms are spread across the landscape and collectively cover a significant land area. Core to Wild Powerâ€™s approach is engaging local communities with solar farms to raise awareness of the multiple benefits of this technology, but also as a means of reconnecting people with nature. The Wild Power approach has been designed for UK solar farms, with aim to expand to wider renewable technologies, and countries in time. It is believed that this approach is novel and has global implications for biodiversity and sustainable development.

Ethiopia is vulnerable to climate change because our economies largely depend on climate-sensitive agricultural production. Environmental changes, such as changes in rainfall variability, drought, warmer or cooler temperature (lead to change in growing seasons) and land cover change have increased concerns about achieving food security. Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) recognized Climate change as a threat and opportunity for Ethiopia. Both climate change adaptation and mitigation issues considered; GTP stipulates the country’s ambition to build a climate resilient green economy by 2030. Climate change impacts on agriculture and livestock is depending on changes in temperature, precipitation and climate variability (such as erratic rainfall, floods and droughts). The complex interaction of these variables makes it difficult to predict how climate change will impact at the regional level. Despite the relatively high knowledge of the subject among policy-makers and the prominent role being played by Ethiopia in International Climate Change Negotiations many factors, such as El Nlno, are contributing to the deterioration of the local climate and making the population ever more vulnerable to global and regional climate change.

Growth and Transformation Plan (GTP) of Ethiopia recognized climate change as a huge threat and focusing on mitigation issues. The GTP stipulates the country’s ambition to build a climate resilient green economy by 2030. This paper looks at the potential of livestock technologies and grazing land management for mitigation and adaption to a changing climate. Research findings in Ethiopia showed that livestock technologies and management of grazing lands such as improving the quality of forage, feeding highly digestible forages, processing and preservation of feeds, use of controlled grazing instead of continuous grazing and inclusion of legumes in forage mixes, have a great response to climate change. The choices for application of the technologies and potential mitigation strategies primarily depend on the adoption and cost associated with it. Grazing land management not only mitigates climate change but also reduces soil erosion, increases carbon sequestration and contributes to the resilience of crop-livestock farming systems in Ethiopia. In conclusion, management of grazing lands and implementation of livestock technologies have good implications in mitigating climate change on top of income generation and thereby improving the livelihood of farmers in Ethiopia. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Drought and food security; Grazing land; Livestock technologies; Methane",,"Mekuriaw, S.; United Graduate School of Agricultural Sciences (UGSAS), 1390 Hamasaka, Japan; email: shigdaf@gmail.com",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071362870

Brazilian electricity matrix is mostly renewable, depending mainly on hydroelectric plants. In recent years, this dependence became critical due to changes in rain seasonality. During dry periods in Brazil, the level of water reservoirs decreases and there is the necessity of producing electricity from other sources. Sugarcane bioelectricity is a reliable source during dry periods and has several advantages such as low greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and low losses during transmission. Another option for dry periods is the activation of thermoelectric plants driven by fossil natural gas. However, such plants have higher emissions of CO2eq per kWh produced compared to sugarcane bioelectricity. Currently, sugarcane sector is producing bioelectricity mostly from bagasse, but straw (sugarcane tops and leaves) presents a huge potential of additional electricity production. This work presents the estimation of the potential electricity production in Brazil considering the recovery of 50% and 70% of straw produced in sugarcane fields, and the potential avoided emissions comparing to other electricity sources. In addition, we performed a Life Cycle Assessment of four sugarcane plants currently recovering straw in Brazil. By recovering 50% of straw, Brazil could supply 48.6% of Brazilian residential consumption of electricity and avoid emission of 31.1 million tonnes of CO2eq to the atmosphere, which represents around 7% of Brazilian energy sector emissions. Even larger mitigation potential can be achieved with higher straw recovery (70%) or if sugarcane mills are optimized for energy generation. Therefore, straw presents huge potential of additional production of bioelectricity in Brazil and, consequently, a huge potential of GHG mitigation. © 2019 ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.","Agricultural residues; CO2 emission; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Life cycle assessment (LCA); Renewable energies; Sugarcane electricity",,,"Scarlat N.Grassi A.Helm P.Carvalho M.d.G.","ETA-Florence Renewable Energies",22825819,,,,"English","European Biomass Conf.

This makes it necessary to implement adaptation and mitigation strategies that contribute to the maintenance of technical efficiency (TE). This study analyzed the relationship of TE with farmers' mitigation and adaptation action preferences, their risk and environmental attitudes, and their perception of climate change. Through the stochastic frontier method, TE levels were estimated for 370 farmers in Northwest Mexico. The results showed the average efficiency levels (57%) for three identified groups of farmers: High TE (15% of farmers), average TE (72%), and low TE (13%). Our results showed a relationship between two of the preferred adaptation actions against climate change estimated using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method. The most efficient farmers preferred ""change crops,"" while less efficient farmers preferred ""invest in irrigation infrastructure."" The anthropocentric environmental attitude inferred from the New Ecological Paradigm (NEP) scale was related to the level of TE. Efficient farmers were those with an anthropocentric environmental attitude, compared to less efficient farmers, who exhibited an ecocentric attitude. The climate change issues were more perceived by moderately efficient farmers. These findings set out a roadmap for policy-makers to face climate change at the regional level. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation and mitigation preferences; Climate change perception; Environmental attitudes; Farmers' risk attitude; Technical efficiency","adaptive management; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; farmers attitude; perception; policy making; preference behavior; risk perception; strategic approach; technical efficiency","Torres, M.A.O.; Institute for Research in Sustainability Science and Technology (IS-UPC), Spain; email: miguel.angel.orduno@upc.edu",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069757842

Systematic and in-depth research into these issues is seldom conducted. In this research we combine qualitative and quantitative studies and use six state-of-the-art energy-economy analysis models and four long term scenarios to explore the distribution of regional contributions for climate change mitigation in the future. We focus on the energy investment gap and policy cost. The study's conclusion is that, under the assumption of carbon tax as a source of energy investment from 2025, the global positive energy investment gap in the climate change mitigation scenario will not appear until around 2035-2040. Asia and OECD90+EU (Countries from the OECD 1990, EU and its candidates) are the regions that will have a significant direct impact on the global energy investment gap under climate policies in the future. However, from the perspective of the relative value (the percentage of the energy investment gap relative to the energy investment in the Current Policies (CPol) scenario), Asia will contribute the most to the global energy investment gap under the climate stability policies. Under the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) scenario, Asia will contribute the most in the near term and REF will contribute the most in the medium term. The findings show that OECD90+EU will bear more cost in the pledges scenario, and Asia will bear more cost in the climate stability scenarios in the medium term. Contrary to the common sense expectation, the developed regions will contribute the least in terms of the proportion of the policy cost to the respective economic aggregates under the climate stability scenarios in the medium and long term, but the opposite is true in the developing regions. By and large, from the perspective of the current climate change mitigation policies, the developed regions and developing regions will achieve a win-win situation in the long run, but the relative contribution of the developed regions is not as great as was previously expected. These novel findings should prove to be useful to policy makers when developing transition strategies for climate change mitigation. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate policy; Energy investment; Energy mix; Policy cost; Regional contribution","climate change; cost analysis; economic conditions; environmental policy; OECD; policy making; pollution tax; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach","Sun, H.; College of Earth and Environmental Sciences, China; email: sunhj15@lzu.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069751865

However, there is a lack of knowledge of adaptation strategies that would be able to reduce the impacts of extreme heat to cope with an uncertain future, especially on the local scale. In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of adaptation strategies to reduce the mortality risk under two climate change mitigation scenarios, using Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 2.6 and 8.5. We selected four street-level adaptation strategies: Green walls, sidewalk greenways, reduced-albedo sidewalks and street trees. As an extreme heat assessment criterion, we used a pedestrian mean radiant temperature threshold, which was strongly related to heat mortality. The results, projected to the 2050s, showed that green walls, greenways and reduced-albedo sidewalks could adequately reduce the extreme heat impacts under RCP2.6; however, only street trees could reduce the extreme heat impacts under RCP8.5 in the 2050s. This implies that required adaptation strategies can vary depending on the targeted scenario. This study was conducted using one street in Seoul, but the methodology can be expanded to include other adaptation strategies, and applied to various locations to help stakeholders decide on effective adaptation options and make local climate change adaptation plans. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change impact; Decision-making; Heat mortality; Mean radiant temperature; RCP","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; extreme event; global warming; heating; mortality; mortality risk; pedestrian; strategic approach; temperature effect; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea","Lee, D.K.; Department of Landscape Architecture and Rural System Engineering, South Korea; email: dklee7@snu.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069005889

The aim of this research is to build a method for managing water potential in river estuaries and arrangement the river estuary area for mitigation of the effects of climate change on water resources in the estuary area, especially in Bali. The method of this research is qualitative research on phenomenology that is happening. Data is collected in the form of primary data and secondary data. Primary data consists of environmental conditions in river estuaries related to climate change that occur, while secondary data in the form of water potential, water quality and land changes are obtained from various related instances. The results of the research found that watersheds on Bali Island are potential watersheds that can be used as raw water sources for both clean water and irrigation water. However, changes in land functions and climate change can cause some negative impacts on the potential and environmental conditions of estuary water resources such as floods, droughts, landslides, pollution of water by pollutants and sedimentation. Mitigation actions that must be taken to reduce the risk for the condition of water resources in river estuaries in Bali due to climate change are managing water potential by managing water systems, conducting water-saving campaigns, integrated management of water availability and needs, environment-based management, strengthening institutions in management of water resources, and the need to regulate cropping patterns right in the river estuary. While in terms of arrangement river estuary area there are several mitigation actions that can be carried out such as the construction of dikes around the estuary area, the construction of reservoirs, the construction of monitoring posts for river estuary conditions and the preservation of deforested areas around river estuary. © 2019 International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.","Arrangement; Climate change; Mitigation; River Estuary; Water potential",,,,"Insight Society",20885334,,,,"English","Int.

Here, I estimate the world’s land share under forests required to prevent dangerous climate change. For this, I combine newest longitudinal data of FLUXNET on forests’ net ecosystem exchange of carbon (NEE) from 78 forest sites (N = 607) with countries’ mean temperature and forest area. This straightforward approach indicates that the world’s forests sequester 8.3 GtCO2year−1. For the 2 °C climate target, the current forest land share has to be doubled to 60.0% to sequester an additional 7.8 GtCO2year−1, which demands less red meat consumption. This afforestation/reforestation (AR) challenge is achievable, as the estimated global biophysical potential of AR is 8.0 GtCO2year−1 safeguarding food supply for 10 billion people. Climate-responsible countries have the highest AR potential. For effective climate policies, knowledge on the major drivers of forest area is crucial. Enhancing information here, I analyze forest land share data of 98 countries from 1990 to 2015 applying causal inference (N = 2494). The results highlight that population growth, industrialization, and increasing temperature reduce forest land share, while more protected forest and economic growth generally increase it. In all, this study confirms the potential of AR for climate change mitigation with a straightforward approach based on the direct measurement of NEE. This might provide a more valid picture given the shortcomings of indirect carbon stock-based inventories. The analysis identifies future regional hotspots for the AR potential and informs the need for fast and forceful action to prevent dangerous climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; FAO; Fixed effects panel regression; FLUXNET; Forest area; Net ecosystem exchange",,"Mader, S.; Institute of Sociology, Fabrikstrasse 8, Switzerland; email: sebastian.mader@soz.unibe.ch",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

To reduce oil consumption and resulting greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon dioxide can be captured from stacks or air and utilized as alternative carbon source for chemicals. Here, we show that carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has the technical potential to decouple chemical production from fossil resources, reducing annual GHG emissions by up to 3.5 Gt CO2-eq in 2030. Exploiting this potential, however, requires more than 18.1 PWh of low-carbon electricity, corresponding to 55% of the projected global electricity production in 2030. Most large-scale CCU technologies are found to be less efficient in reducing GHG emissions per unit low-carbon electricity when benchmarked to power-to-X efficiencies reported for other large-scale applications including electro-mobility (e-mobility) and heat pumps.

The prospective synergies between mitigation and adaptation approaches and sustainable development are assessed. Also, the pathways through which resource constraints and institutional and policy environment affect Africa’s ability to mitigate and adapt to climate change are examined, as well as the degree to which these constraints are being addressed. It is argued that Africa’s ability to benefit from sustainable development synergies embedded in the mitigation and adaptation strategies in the INDCs will be greatly limited by institutional and policy environment that hinders funding, capacity building, and technological innovation systems development. The slow pace of efforts to address these impediments further erodes confidence that climate adaptation in Africa will be effective at sufficiently contributing to a reduction in climate change risks to the continent. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Africa; Climate change; Climate policy; Mitigation and adaption; Sustainable development",,"Nyiwul, L.M.; Department of Economics, United States; email: lnyiwul@gettysburg.edu",,"Physica-Verlag",14311933,,,,"English","Contr.

These values are compared to the emissions for internal combustion engines (ICE) of varying efficiencies. Many studies quantify carbon dioxide emissions based on a static grid, but this fails to accurately measure the long-term potential of electric vehicles. This model disaggregates grid-based and non-grid-based emissions, which allows production-based emissions to accurately reflect the percentage of renewable energy that is entered into the model. Argonne National Laboratory's GREET Model and a variety of meta-analyses are used to determine the emissions per kWh and per gallon. The model also allows for the manipulation of a variety of variables other than the percentage of renewable energy, including: EV efficiency, miles per gallon, and battery-based emissions. The lifecycle EV carbon emissions for a vehicle powered by the 2016 US grid is 30.82 metric tons, while the emissions for an EV powered by 100 percent renewable energy is 6.3 metric tons. An average internal combustion engine vehicle (25.4 miles per gallon) is responsible for 68.38 metric tons of carbon dioxide over its lifetime, while an ICE vehicle with a utopian efficiency of 80 miles per gallon accounts for 25.5 metric tons of carbon dioxide. © Common Ground, Ryan Cornell.","Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Electric Vehicles; Emissions; Sustainable Transportation",,"Cornell, R.; School of Sustainability, PO Box 875502, United States; email: rcornell@asu.edu",,"Common Ground Research Networks",18357156,,,,"English","Int.

This chapter provides an assessment framework and a case study of the potential savings in energy use and CO 2 emissions from alternative fuel vehicle technologies compared to existing conventional vehicles, including the dynamic modelling of different mitigation strategies at the fleet level. The case study is done in an urban area of Lebanon’s Greater Beirut Area which has one of the most unsustainable road transport systems in the region. The framework highlights the need to account for real-world driving and weather conditions since poor roads, congested traffic, and extreme weather conditions common in the developing countries of the Middle East can reduce the benefits of these vehicles. Results show that introducing micro-hybrid vehicles to make up 35% of the fleet in 2040 reduces energy use and emissions by 19% compared to the business-as-usual scenario, thereby stabilizing growth trends in 2040 as compared to 2010 figures. The addition of 10% hybrid electric vehicles by 2040 to the first strategy leads to 11% additional savings compared to 2010. This shows the need to incentivize cleaner fuel vehicles and to systematically explore additional strategies for reducing energy consumption and emissions in road transportation. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.","Alternative fuel vehicles; Cost analysis; Developing countries; Energy consumption; GHG emissions; Mitigation strategies; Real driving conditions; Road passenger transport; System dynamics",,"Haddad, M.; Department of Industrial and Mechanical Engineering, United States; email: mhaddad@lau.edu.lb",,"Springer Verlag",18600832,,,,"English","Underst.

As a leading agricultural state with a diverse agricultural portfolio, California will face its own unique regional challenges due to its complex agricultural inter-dependencies. As veterinarians and animal scientists with livestock and poultry clientele in the Central Valley of California, we are starting to observe changes in food safety, production efficiency, welfare and disease that can be linked to the effects of climate change. For example, in California drought has reduced access to rice hulls which are commonly used as bedding for poultry which have necessitated the use for recycling rice hulls. Our results have shown an 11.08 × greater risk (P < 0.5) of Salmonella in poultry raised on litter recycled more than 3 × versus poultry raised on fresh litter material. While these types of challenges can be mitigated through adapting husbandry, it is also important to recognize that there are opportunities for the farmers to focus on mitigation of greenhouse gases via the alternative usage of agricultural ‘waste’ products with a focus on increasing baseload renewable energy from anaerobic digestion (AD). Specifically, the further targeted integration of methane digesters in the Central Valley of California could play a significant role in renewable energy production from carbon-based agricultural ‘waste’ material. To that point, geographic information system-based maps were made showing the spatial location of major livestock and crop production areas laid over the current natural gas pipeline network for Fresno County (the most productive agricultural county in the USA). Refinement and further development of these types of maps are integral in order to visualize and develop a robust and commercially viable AD network into our current energy infrastructure. This review aims to describe current scenarios spanning food safety, welfare and the connection between animal disease and production efficiency in California livestock and poultry production with respect to how climate change affects California livestock and poultry. © CAB International 2019","California; Climate change; Energy; Livestock; Poultry",,"Pitesky, M.; Department of Population Health and Reproduction, Cooperative Extension, 1089 Veterinary Medicine Dr., VM3B, United States; email: mepitesky@ucdavis.edu",,"CABI International",17498848,,,,"English","CAB Rev.

This specifically applies to the mobilization of investment for climate change mitigation and adaptation. One way to mobilize foreign investments is to create a favourable investment climate with the help of multilateral investment treaties. In this article, a model treaty is proposed to considerably increase climate-friendly investments while maintaining regulatory flexibility for signatory states. Building on Design Thinking principles, key challenges for the success of such a treaty are identified and provisions are crafted incorporating feedback from twenty-five experts from finance, policy, and legal domains. The proposal addresses four key challenges: (1) define climate change mitigation and adaptation investments; (2) decrease the barrier of limited access to capital due to perceived and actual risks; (3) combat insufficient investor trust in long-term contracts; and (4) retain states' ability to regulate. The treaty proposal addresses these challenges by proposing, inter alia, a definition for mitigation and adaptation investments that establishes a link to the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement, an innovative financing mechanism, a conversion of host country subsidies to investment grants, and a performance verification using latest distributed ledger technology. © 2019 Kluwer Law International BV, The Netherlands.",,,"Elrifai, S.N.; Amereller Rechtsanwälte PartGGermany; email: elrifai@amereller.com",,"Kluwer Law International",02558106,,,,"English","J.

Investment and the legal regimes that govern it-including international investment law-are critical to this shift. To accelerate it, the authors propose the Treaty on Sustainable Investment for Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation. One of the winners of the Stockholm Treaty Lab competition, the treaty has three building blocks: (1) encouraging Sustainable Investments; (2) discouraging Unsustainable Investments and eliminating new Unsustainable Investments; and (3) ensuring a just transition to sustainable and low-carbon economies and societies. It allows states to indicate, in schedules to the annexes of the treaty, which sectors will be defined as Sustainable or Unsustainable Investments. It protects and signals policy support for Sustainable Investments, while denying treaty-based procedural rights to Unsustainable Investments and committing states to agree on modalities and timelines for phasing out incentives for Unsustainable Investments, such as fossil fuel subsidies.

However, in order to maximize outcomes, both scholars and practitioners are increasingly calling for more integrated and synergetic approaches. Unfortunately, related research remains scarce and fragmented, and there is a lack of systematic investigation into the necessary institutional conditions and processes. Against this background, this paper develops a framework to assess and support the joint institutionalization of climate adaptation and mitigation—here called adaptigation—in city administrations. This pioneering framework draws upon four key features of bureaucracies: organizational structure, visions and goals, actors, and technology and tools. Illustrated by pilot applications to the cities of Würzburg (Germany) and Mwanza (Tanzania), the framework provides a robust basis for future research, policy recommendations, and the development of context-specific guidelines for national and local decision-makers and officials. It highlights the importance of (i) clearly defined procedures for the implementation of adaptigation into urban planning processes (e.g., with the active involvement of stakeholders in the form of working groups or roundtable discussions), (ii) locally relevant goals and visions, established in collaboration with stakeholders, and (iii) the creation of mitigation and adaptation structures that are supported by the appropriate level of human resources, both within and outside city administrations. In this context, global, supranational, and national institutions play an important role in supporting institutionalization by providing targeted funding and promoting adaptigation, which requires the development of integrated goals, visions, and legislation. © 2018, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate policy integration; Institutionalization; Mainstreaming; Mitigation; Municipal planning; Urban planning","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; environmental policy; human resource; integrated approach; policy implementation; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban area; urban planning; Germany; Mwanza [Tanzania]; Tanzania","Göpfert, C.; Institute of Energy Efficient and Sustainable Design and Building (ENPB), Arcisstr. 21, Germany; email: christian.goepfert@tum.de",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

We ask whether this conclusion also holds for Norway. Our starting point is the political science literature on “old” versus “new” politics, old politics being defined in socio-economic left or right terms and new politics being defined in accordance with an authoritarian or libertarian dimension in which environmental protection plays an important role. Based on these two axes, Herbert Kitschelt finds a new axis—a diagonal—combining old and new divides. According to Kitschelt, voters with traditional environmental attitudes have leftist and libertarian values, while voters favouring economic growth have rightist and authoritarian values. Using Norwegian data, we compare voters who favour traditional environmental protection and take climate change seriously with voters who only take climate change seriously. We expect that if climate change is perceived as one of many environmental threats, then the two voter groups are similar. We find that half of the voters see climate change as a big problem. Two thirds of these voters are in favour of environmental protection. However, the last third of these voters who take climate change seriously do not want greater environmental protection. Moreover, we find interesting differences between these groups. Those in the latter group have leftist and libertarian values, whereas climate-only voters have rightist and authoritarian values. Thus the two groups of voters are dissimilar. Interestingly, this pattern corresponds to alignments along Kitschelt's new diagonal axis for party competition. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment","climate change; environment; Norway; voters","authoritarianism; climate change; environmental politics; environmental protection; liberalism; party politics; public attitude; voting behavior; Norway","Aardal, B.; Department of Political Science, Norway; email: bernt.aardal@stv.uio.no",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",1756932X,,,,"English","Environ.

Furthermore, it can be used in combination with carbon capture and storage to provide so-called “negative emissions”. At the same time, however, its production will require land, possibly impacting food security, land-based carbon stocks, and other environmental services. Thus, the strategies adopted in the supply, conversion, and use of biomass have a significant impact on its effectiveness as a climate change mitigation measure. We use the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model to project three different global, long term scenarios spanning different socioeconomic futures with varying rates of population growth, economic growth, and technological change, and investigate the role of biomass in meeting strict climate targets. Using these scenarios we highlight different possibilities for biomass supply and demand, and provide insights on the requirements and challenges for the effective use of this resource as a climate change mitigation measure. The results show that in scenarios meeting the 1.5 °C target, biomass could exceed 20% of final energy consumption, or 115–180 EJPrim/yr in 2050. Such a supply of bioenergy can only be achieved without extreme levels land use change if agricultural yields improve significantly and effective land zoning is implemented. Furthermore, the results highlight that strict mitigation targets are contingent on the availability of advanced technologies such as lignocellulosic fuels and carbon capture and storage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Biochemicals; Bioenergy; Climate policy; Energy system; Land use; Scenario analysis","assessment method; biochemistry; bioenergy; biomass; climate change; electricity supply; environmental policy; integrated approach; land use change; scenario analysis","Daioglou, V.; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency, PO Box 30314, Netherlands; email: vassilis.daioglou@pbl.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

This article contends that subjective attribution of extreme weather events to climate change is a necessary condition for extreme weather experiences to be translated into climate change mitigation responses, and that subjective attribution of extreme weather to climate change is influenced by the psychological and social contexts in which individuals appraise their experiences with extreme weather. Using survey data gathered in the aftermath of severe flooding across the UK in winter 2013/2014, personal experience of this flooding event is shown to only directly predict perceived threat from climate change, and indirectly predict climate change mitigation responses, among individuals who subjectively attributed the floods to climate change. Additionally, subjective attribution of the floods to climate change is significantly predicted by pre-existing climate change belief, political affiliation and perceived normative cues. Attempts to harness extreme weather experiences as a route to engaging the public must be attentive to the heterogeneity of opinion on the attributability of extreme weather events to climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Attribution; Climate change; Experience; Extreme weather; Risk perception","climate change; extreme event; flooding; heterogeneity; literature review; local participation; perception; psychology; public attitude; risk perception; weather; winter; United Kingdom","Ogunbode, C.A.; Department of Psychosocial Science, Christesgate 12, Post Box 7807, Norway; email: Charles.Ogunbode@uib.no",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

Using data from three case studies, we highlight the ways that industrial development and CCMA initiatives are intertwined in both policy and project creation, and how this confluence is creating potentials for maladaptive outcomes. Each case study involves partnerships between international institutions and the national government, each deploys CCMA as either a primary or supporting legitimation, and each failed to adhere to institutional and/or internationally recognized standards of justice. In Cambodia, mismanaged projects are typically blamed on the kleptocratic and patrimonial governance system. We show how such blame obscures the collusion of international partners, who also sidestep their own safeguards, and ignores the potential for maladaptation at the project level and the adverse social and environmental impacts of the policies themselves. Key policy insights Initiatives to mitigate or adapt to climate change look very much like the development projects that caused climate change: Extreme caution must be exercised to ensure policies and projects do not exacerbate the conditions driving climate change. Safeguards ‘on paper’ are insufficient to avoid negative impacts and strict accountability mechanisms must be put in place. Academic researchers can be part of that accountability mechanism through case study reports, policy briefs, technical facilitation to help ensure community needs are met and safeguards are executed as written. Impacts beyond the project scale must be assessed to avoid negative consequences for social and ecological systems at the landscape level. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Large-scale expansions of bioenergy have been suggested as an important component for climate change mitigation. Here we use harmonized climate and land-use projections to investigate their potential combined impacts on global vertebrate diversity under a low- and a high-level emission scenario. We combine climate-based species distribution models for the world’s amphibians, birds, and mammals with land-use change simulations and identify areas threatened by both climate and land-use change in the future. The combined projected effects of climate and land-use change on vertebrate diversity are similar under the two scenarios, with land-use change effects being stronger under the low- and climate change effects under the high-emission scenario. Under the low-emission scenario, increases in bioenergy cropland may cause severe impacts in biodiversity that are not compensated by lower climate change impacts. Under this low-emission scenario, larger proportions of species distributions and a higher number of small-range species may become impacted by the combination of land-use and climate change than under the high-emission scenario, largely a result of bioenergy cropland expansion. Our findings highlight the need to carefully consider both climate and land-use change when projecting biodiversity impacts. We show that biodiversity is likely to suffer severely if bioenergy cropland expansion remains a major component of climate change mitigation strategies. Our study calls for an immediate and significant reduction in energy consumption for the benefit of both biodiversity and to achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

REDD+ countries must develop definitions for national and subnational forests to enhance forest monitoring and they must develop technical and institutional infrastructure for MRV and safeguard systems, to receive results-based payments, and for the sustainability of REDD+ projects. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change mitigation; National REDD+ strategy; REDD+; Sustainability; UNFCCC","climate change; comparative study; deforestation; developing world; emission inventory; expert system; implementation process; literature review; mitigation; strategic approach; sustainability; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Africa; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim","Lee, Y.; Department of Forest Resources and Landscape Architecture, South Korea; email: johnlee@yu.ac.kr",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058552101

Given these influences and feedbacks, might part of the solution for mitigating anthropogenic climate change lie in the restoration of extant megafauna to ecosystems? Here, we explore the potential role of trophic rewilding on Earth's climate system. We first provide a novel synthesis of the various ways that megafauna interact with the major drivers of anthropogenic climate change, including greenhouse gas storage and emission, aerosols and albedo. We then explore the role of rewilding as a mitigation tool at two scales: (i) current and near-future opportunities for national or regional climate change mitigation portfolios, and (ii) more radical opportunities at the global scale. Finally, we identify major knowledge gaps that complicate the complete characterization of rewilding as a climate change mitigation strategy.

The tourism sector has likewise pledged to reduce its GHG emissions (−70% by 2050); however, current emission trends would result in a tripling in the same timeframe. In order to understand how the sector understands the decarbonisation challenge, 17 senior tourism leaders were interviewed with regard to their perspectives on the risks and opportunities associated with climate change impacts and action. Respondents affirmed that the climate is already changing, fuelled by human activities, including tourism, and that its impacts on society and tourism will be largely negative and devastating in some regions. Opinion was divided regarding mitigation timelines, the compatibility of continued tourism growth with Paris Climate Agreement decarbonisation goals, and the role of technology and governance in reducing emissions. The paper examines leaders’ perspectives in terms of “belief systems” that interpret information in decision-making, as well as forms of agnogenesis; this is, the fabrication of uncertainty to justify non-action. Belief systems and agnogenesis are thought to represent important barriers to progress on the decarbonisation of tourism, as they are for the global low-carbon transition. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

In addition to the impacts of deficient urban planning on the environment, climate change will have environmental, socioeconomic and cultural impacts in urban areas. In the food sector, climate change will possibly cause impacts in the whole food chain, altering dietary practices and food security. On the other hand, dietary behavior patterns should also be taken into consideration, since those have an important role in the emission of greenhouse gases. From this perspective, climate and food system perceptions, as possible drivers for behavioral changes, are of great importance in the search of solutions for contemporary socioeconomic issues. Therefore, an investigation with graduate students (N=1526) from various study areas of the University of Brasilia, Brazil, was developed, aiming to understand the perceptions regarding climate change and the food sector. The researchers found that, in addition to the perception of climate change and the impacts in urban areas, various impacts are perceived on the food sector. The observed patters are discussed as a means to indicate a role for dietary education in behavioral changes towards food usage and choices more compatible to a sustainable diet, with positive impact for the environment, individuals and communities. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

In this paper, first the adaptation-mitigation dichotomy and definitions of adaptation and mitigation are discussed. This is followed by a comprehensive scrutiny of the perceptual overlaps and distinctions between adaptation and mitigation, which include a meta-analysis of synergies and trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation in the agriculture and forestry sectors. The analysis shows that activities greatly depend on their context, design and implementation, so actions have to be tailored to the specific conditions, as few, if any, outcomes are universal. The analysis also indicates that the forestry sector delivers more synergies and has more trade-offs when compared to agriculture, which could be because of the fact that forest areas contain significantly more carbon, but at the same time they also compete with alternative land-uses.

Although the health system has a key role to play in addressing these health effects, so too do those professions tasked with the development of the built environment (urban and regional planners, urban designers, landscapers and architects), through improvements to buildings, streets, neighbourhoods, suburbs and cities. This article reports on the ways in which urban planning and design, and architectural interventions, can address the health effects of climate change; and the scope of climate change adaptation and mitigation approaches being implemented by the built environment professions. Type of program or service: Built environment adaptations and mitigations and their connections to the ways in which urban planning, urban design and architectural practices are addressing the health effects of climate change. Methods: Our reflections draw on the findings of a recent review of existing health and planning literature. First, we explore the ways in which ‘adaptation’ and ‘mitigation’ relate to the notion of human and planetary health. We then outline the broad scope of adaptation and mitigation interventions being envisioned, and in some instances actioned, by built environment professionals. Results: Analysis of the review’s findings reveals that adaptations developed by built environment professions predominantly focus on protecting human health and wellbeing from the effects of climate change. In contrast, built environment mitigations address climate change by embracing a deeper understanding of the co-benefits inherent in the interconnectedness of human health and wellbeing and the health of the ecosystem on which it depends. In the final section, we highlight the ethical transition that these approaches demand of built environment professions. Lessons learnt: Built environment interventions must move beyond simple ecological sustainability to encouraging ways of life that are healthy for both humans and the planet. There are key challenges facing this new approach. © 2018 Prior et al.",,"article; built environment; city planning; climate change; ecosystem; human; human experiment; occupation; wellbeing; environmental planning; ethics; greenhouse effect; health; organization and management; prevention and control; sustainable development; Built Environment; City Planning; Climate Change; Environment Design; Global Warming; Health; Humans; Sustainable Development","Prior, J.H.; Institute for Sustainable Futures, Australia; email: Jason.Prior@uts.edu.au",,"Sax Institute",22042091,,,"30652192","English","Public Health Res.

Elevated ambient temperature during the summer months can have a significant influence on the basic physiology of the rumen, thereby affecting the nutritional status of the animals. Rumen volatile fatty acid (VFA) production decreases under conditions of extreme heat. Growing recent evidence suggests there are genetic variations among breeds of goats in the impact of heat stress on rumen fermentation pattern and VFA production. Most of the effects of heat stress on rumen fermentation and enteric methane (CH4) emission are attributed to differences in the rumen microbial population. Heat stress-induced rumen function impairment is mainly associated with an increase in Streptococcus genus bacteria and with a decrease in the bacteria of Fibrobactor genus. Apart from its major role in global warming and greenhouse effect, enteric CH4 is also considered as a dietary energy loss in goats. These effects warrant mitigating against CH4 production to ensure optimum economic return from goat farming as well as to reduce the impact on global warming as CH4 is one of the more potent greenhouse gases (GHG). The various strategies that can be implemented to mitigate enteric CH4 emission include nutritional interventions, different management strategies and applying advanced biotechnological tools to find solution to reduce CH4 production. Through these advanced technologies, it is possible to identify genetically superior animals with less CH4 production per unit feed intake. These efforts can help the farming community to sustain goat production in the changing climate scenario. © 2018 by the authors.

Increased C is beneficial for some soil structures and functions, improving the use of water and in turn the crop adaptation. This study reports on the synergy between mitigation and adaptation in agriculture through the paradigm of the olive (Olea europaea). Through data on net ecosystem productivity and soil respiration, the role of olive groves to store C in tree biomass (from 0.36 to 2.78 t CO 2 ha 1 yr 1 ) and into soil (∼8.5 t CO 2 ha 1 yr 1 ) is reviewed. The influence of some management practices on that role is also discussed. The overall climatic impact of olive fruit and oil production has been evaluated also considering GHG emissions by field operations (e.g., pruning, mulching of cover crop, fertilization, harvest, etc.) and by the extraction and bottling of oil. Soil C as interface between climate change mitigation and adaptation has been delineated, linking C-induced improvements in soil properties to increased water storage and reduced run-off and erosion.

More and more countries have decided to propose their goals such as Paris agreements, to reduce emitting these heat trapping compounds for sustainability. The Asian region houses dramatic changes with diverse religions and cultures, large populations as well as a rapidly changing socio-economic situations all of which are contributing to generating a mammoth amount of GHGs; hence, they require calls for related studies on climate change strategies. After pre-filtering of GHG emission information, 24 Asian countries have been selected as primary target countries. Hierarchical cluster analysis method using complete linkage technique was successfully applied for appropriate grouping. Six groups were categorized through GHG emission properties with major and minor emission sectors based on the GHG inventory covering energy, industrial processes, agriculture, waste, land use change, and forestry and bunker fuels. Assigning six groups using cluster analysis finally implied that the approach to establish GHG emission boundaries was meaningful to develop further mitigation strategies. Following the outcome of this study, calculating amount of reduction potential in suitable sectors as well as determining best practice, technology, and regulatory framework can be improved by policy makers, environmental scientists, and planners at the different levels. Therefore, this work on reviewing a wide range of GHG emission history and establishing boundaries of emission characteristics would provide further direction of effective climate change mitigation for sustainability and resilience in Asia. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Asian countries; Climate change mitigation; Cluster analysis; GHG inventory","climate change; cluster analysis; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; international agreement; mitigation; regulatory framework; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; sustainability; Asia","Lee, H.; International Institute for Applied Systems AnalysisAustria; email: hlee@inu.ac.kr",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

The approach used allows for evaluating the interactions between climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies under low and high impact scenarios through 2050. Climate change impact projections of sixteen General Circulation Models indicate that a global high emissions trajectory scenario would likely yield more severe impacts on hydropower generation than a mitigation scenario. Adaptation modeling suggests that climate change impacts can be compensated by a wide range of alternatives, whose optimality will depend on the level of mitigation effort pursued. Our results show that climate change impacts would lead to even higher emissions in the absence of climate change mitigation policies. On the other hand, mitigation strategies to pursue lower emissions are maintained under climate change impacts, meaning that mitigation strategies are robust when faced with adaptation challenges. Mitigation efforts could yield a more diverse and less carbon intensive mix of technological options for adaptation. When analyzing investment costs to adapt to climate change impacts, in some cases mitigation can lead to a lower total investment level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Brazil; Climate change; Energy system model; Hydropower; Mitigation","Climate models; Hydroelectric power; Investments; Adaptation; Brazil; Energy system model; Hydropower; Mitigation; Climate change; adaptation; climate change; climate effect; emission; hydroelectric power; investment; mitigation; Brazil","Lucena, A.F.P.; Energy Planning Program, Brazil; email: andrelucena@ppe.ufrj.br",,"Elsevier Ltd",03605442,,ENEYD,,"English","Energy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054712165

Climate change is affecting New Zealand through changes in precipitation patterns, increases in temperature, changes to the frequency and duration of droughts, sea level rise, and the increased occurrence of extreme events. These impacts highlight the vulnerability of key economic activities, communities, and infrastructure. As environmental and socioeconomic vulnerability varies with place, local level climate change policies are important tools to increase resilience when faced with a changing climate. The research survey, targeted towards local elected representatives, unpacks local scale climate change planning efforts across the country, as well as decision-maker perceptions of barriers and motivations in the area of climate change planning. Findings suggest that increasing local-scale responses hinges on public perception of the urgency of climate change, which is heavily influenced by national priorities. Furthermore, support for national level responses is limited by a collective view of climate change as an issue of an uncertain future, rather than one of present concern. Thus, the inclination to act at the local level is to some extent undermined by slow national action. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation and mitigation; Barriers; Climate change; Local scale planning; Online survey; Perceptions of climate change",,"Archie, K.M.; Victoria University of Wellington, Po Box 600, New Zealand; email: kelli.archie@vuw.ac.nz",,"Elsevier B.V.",22114645,,,,"English","Environ.

Against the backdrop of the US government’s announcement to withdraw from the Paris agreement, the rise of populist governments across the globe, and the slow progress of energy transformation projects in pluralistic countries, this paper focuses on China’s potential role in climate change mitigation. Since 2008, the Chinese government has switched to a proactive stance on climate governance and low-carbon development. Due to significant improvements in CO2 efficiency and a clear slow-down in the rise of its annual total CO2 emissions, China is increasingly perceived as a new low-carbon champion and appears to be in a position to take over global climate mitigation leadership. This comment examines the drivers behind current low-carbon developments in China and tests the assumption that China’s state-led non-participatory authoritarianism will effectively offer a solution to the global climate problem. Any switch to low-carbon development rests on complex societal preconditions and requirements. This paper discusses the reasons why the likelihood that the Chinese authoritarian regime will be effective over the long-term in lowering greenhouse gas emissions is uncertain at best—because of internal contestations, low public and private-business participation, and countervailing strategies to secure China’s global market positions. Understanding the foundations and nature of China’s climate change mitigation championship has important implications for fostering low-carbon developments in all political regimes. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,"Engels, A.; Centre for Globalisation and Governance, Germany; email: anita.engels@uni-hamburg.de",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",20551045,,,,"English","Palgrave Commun.",Note,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053489534

This article contributes to the policy literature by shedding light on the conditions, which incentivize countries to adopt more climate mitigation policies. The theoretical argument builds on the integrated approaches to study policy diffusion, which include both internal and external determinants as explanations for the adoption of policies. While previous applications typically operationalize the latter by regional proximity, this study highlights the added value of network dependencies capturing political and cooperative interactions across countries. The article finds that the adoption of climate policies is a matter of social influence. Countries are more likely to adopt policies if they cooperate with countries that have adopted more climate policies and are in a similar structural position to countries that are active in climate protection.

It addresses opinions on the inclusion of climate change mitigation strategies (such as Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation-REDD+) into cocoa production, and potential obstacles and roles of stakeholders in ensuring community acceptance of such strategies in a unique multiple land use area-the Krokosua Hills Forest Reserve. Data from the Ghana Meteorological Agency and through survey of 205 cocoa farmers were assessed with Mann-Kendall, KruskalWallis and Mann-Whitney tests. Farmers' perceptions of changes in climate were notably diverse and did not always match historic weather data, but accurately described increases in temperature and drought which are linked to cocoa productivity. Farmers appreciate the importance of tree maintenance for ecosystem services but were skeptical of financially rewarding climate change strategies which favor tree protection. Cultural practices associated with cocoa production encourage carbon release and may pose a threat to the objectives of REDD+. Farmers' experience on the land, interactions with other farmers, government extension agents and cocoa buyers all influence cocoa agroforestry practices in the area, and communication through existing entities (particularly extension agents) presents a pathway to community acceptance of climate change mitigation strategies. The study recommends reforms in REDD+ strategies to adopt flexible and participatory frameworks to facilitate adoption and acceptability due to pronounced heterogeneity in community perceptions and knowledge of climate change and related issues. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Cocoa; Ghana; Participatory; Perceptions; REDD+; Smallholder; Stakeholders","Cocoa; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Land use; Sensory perception; Ghana; Participatory; REDD; Smallholder; Stakeholders; Climate change; climate change; cocoa; deforestation; emission control; participatory approach; perception; smallholder; stakeholder; Acceptability; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Ghana; Land Use; Perception; Production; Trees; Ghana; Theobroma cacao","Ameyaw, L.K.; School of Environmental and Forest Sciences, P.O.

Rice farmers as the main actors are heavily impacted by climate change risks through the increasing difficulties of farming development. Therefore, there should be a protection program for farmers from the negative impacts of climate change. Agricultural insurance is one form of adaptation to the impact of climate change that is potentially developed in Indonesia and began to be initiated since 2015 by the Indonesian government through the policy, called Asuransi Usaha Tani Padi (AUTP) in Indonesian. This study aims to determine the factors that affect farmers' participation in the insurance program, by analyzing the farmer's willingness to pay (WTP) using logistic regression. Data were collected from Karawang Regency, West Java which contributes to the national rice demand of 865,000 tons per year. This study found that significant factors influencing farmer's decision to participate in the crop insurance program were farm size, land status, farmer's income, and expenditure, also the value of WTP Bid. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Crops; Food supply; Insurance; Risk assessment; Climate change impact; Climate change risks; Crop insurance; Farmer's incomes; Food security; Logistic regressions; Risk mitigation; Willingness to pay; Climate change","Dewi, N.; Graduate School, Jl.

This paper aims to inform discussions centred on South Africa’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) by estimating (1) emissions reduction pathways for the country using the Climate Equity Reference Calculator (CERC) assuming a maximum 2°C aggregate warming target and (2) the likely economy-wide net mitigation costs or savings associated with reaching these pathways if known lower-cost mitigation measures, identified through the national mitigation potential analysis, are prioritised. The cumulative net savings associated with achieving the CERC ‘fair share’ emissions pathway, assuming the moderate use of low carbon power generation measures, would reach $5.3 billion by 2030. Net savings could be substantially greater reaching $46.8 billion by 2030 assuming power generation focuses on moving towards full decarbonisation. An unconditional commitment to the mitigation action implied by the ‘fair share’ emissions pathway therefore seems reasonable and prudent purely from the point of view of net country-wide savings. Only if power generation moves towards full decarbonisation would there be a reasonable chance of achieving the more ambitious CERC domestic emissions pathway. However, the significant additional cost associated with achieving the domestic emissions pathway should be conditional on international assistance. Key policy insights South Africa can only achieve its ‘fair share’ of the global mitigation effort if greater use is made of renewable energy options, and can realise significant net savings if it does so. Further emissions reductions would incur costs and require significant upscaling of the share of renewable energy and full implementation of all non-power generation mitigation measures available. Committing to this further mitigation action contingent on international finance would both strengthen the nation’s position in climate negotiations and support the provision of finance for those vulnerable developing nations that bear little or no responsibility for climate change. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","fair share; Mitigation costs; mitigation savings; NDCs; South Africa","alternative energy; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; emission control; environmental policy; global climate; South Africa","Van Zyl, H.; Independent Economic Researchers, 304 Commerce House, 55 Shortmarket Street, South Africa; email: hugo@independentecon.co.za",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

This article proposes a range of country-level targets for mitigation of agricultural emissions by allocating a global target according to five approaches to effort-sharing for climate change mitigation: responsibility, capability, equality, responsibility-capability-need and equal cumulative per capita emissions. Allocating mitigation targets according to responsibility for total historical emissions or capability to mitigate assigned large targets for agricultural emission reductions to North America, Europe and China. Targets based on responsibility for historical agricultural emissions resulted in a relatively even distribution of targets among countries and regions. Meanwhile, targets based on equal future agricultural emissions per capita or equal per capita cumulative emissions assigned very large mitigation targets to countries with large agricultural economies, while allowing some densely populated countries to increase agricultural emissions. There is no single ‘correct’ framework for allocating a global mitigation goal. Instead, using these approaches as a set provides a transparent, scientific basis for countries to inform and help assess the significance of their commitments to reducing emissions from the agriculture sector. Key policy insights Meeting the Paris Agreement 2°C goal will require global mitigation of agricultural non-CO2 emissions of approximately 1 GtCO2e yr−1 by 2030. Allocating this 1 GtCO2e yr−1 according to various effort-sharing approaches, it is found that countries will need to mitigate agricultural business-as-usual emissions in 2030 by a median of 10%. Targets vary widely with criteria used for allocation. The targets calculated here are in line with the ambition of the few countries (primarily in Africa) that included mitigation targets for the agriculture sector in their (Intended) Nationally Determined Contributions. For agriculture to contribute to meeting the 2°C or 1.5°C targets, countries will need to be ambitious in pursuing emission reductions. Technology development and transfer will be particularly important. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

Some food security programmes (including Ethiopia’s Productive Safety Net Program–PSNP–which provides a case study for this article) have integrated aid in exchange for labour on public works to reduce long-term dependence by investing in the productive capacity and resilience of communities. Using this approach, Ethiopia has embarked upon an ambitious national programme of land restoration and sustainable land management. Although the intent was to reduce poverty, here we show that an unintended co-benefit is the climate-change mitigation from reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increased landscape carbon stocks. The article first shows that the total reduction in net GHG emissions from PSNP’s land management at the national scale is estimated at 3.4 million Mg CO2e y−1–approximately 1.5% of the emissions reductions in Ethiopia’s Nationally Determined Contribution for the Paris Agreement. The article then explores some of the opportunities and constraints to scaling up of this impact. Key policy insights Food security programmes (FSPs) can contribute to climate change mitigation by creating a vehicle for investment in land and ecosystem restoration. Maximizing mitigation, while enhancing but not compromising food security, requires that climate projections, and mitigation and adaptation responses should be mainstreamed into planning and implementation of FSPs at all levels. Cross-cutting oversight is required to integrate land restoration, climate policy, food security and disaster risk management into a coherent policy framework. Institutional barriers to optimal implementation should be addressed, such as incentive mechanisms that reward effort rather than results, and lack of centralized monitoring and evaluation of impacts on the physical environment. Project implementation can often be improved by adopting best management practices, such as using productive living livestock barriers where possible, and increasing the integration of agroforestry and non-timber forest products into landscape regeneration. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

We develope a consumption-based framework, which combines input–output analysis, a power-of-pull approach and structural path analysis, and applied it to supply chain networks derived from 2010 and 2012 Jing-Jin-Ji interregional input–output tables. The aim of this study is to identify (1) the key economic sectors for controlling carbon emissions and their changes, (2) the critical directions from a carbon-pulling sector to the emissions of key economic sectors, and (3) the paths with the largest carbon emissions flux in these critical directions. Our results show that the key sectors are from Hebei and Tianjin, more concentrated in Hebei.

We developed a spatial-explicit model at a county level to understand the GHG trade-offs associated with different spatial-temporal CCS and clean fuels dissemination strategies. A business as usual (BAU) and three alternative scenarios with different targets for CCS and LPG dissemination were constructed. Results show that a scenario focusing exclusively on a fast LPG-penetration does not deliver the largest GHG benefits, as there is substantial stacking with traditional open fires. On the contrary, the combination of CCS plancha-type stoves disseminated in regions with high non-renewable fuelwood harvesting (fNRB) together with LPG, allows minimizing of stacking with traditional fires and provide the largest benefits. Also, different scenarios result in contrasting spatial distribution of target counties and mitigation benefits, and therefore have important public policy implications. Cumulative mitigation ranged from 50 MtCO2 e to 126.3 MtCO2 e , depending on the scenario, representing from 14% to 35% of BAU emissions, and up to 11% of projected country GHG emissions to 2030. A sensitivity analysis also showed that despite the variation across three of the main variables affecting GHG's emissions, the CCS-fNRB-LPG scenario remains the most effective and the high LPG penetration scenario remains the most unfavorable. The study helped to identify 200 high-priority municipalities (8% of total) located in the Center-South of Mexico encompassing 30% national FW consumption, 31% total FW users, and 55% of total GHG mitigation. In these high-priority counties a win-win policy in terms of social, health and environmental objectives may be achieved in the short-term, improving the efficacy of public policies related to GHG mitigation, universal access to clean energy, and sustainable development. © 2018 The Author(s).

Climate change and extreme events are interrelated, and climate change is likely to lead to more frequent and severe hazards. Hazard mitigation offers tools to address the hazards that are influenced by climate change and minimize community-level exposure or vulnerability. State Hazard Mitigation Officers in the 56 U.S. states, territories, and the District of Columbia involved in FEMA's Hazard Mitigation Grant Program were surveyed to assess the extent to which climate change has been integrated into State Hazard Mitigation Plans (SHMPs) and the barriers and facilitators to such climate change integration. The majority of responding states reported integration of climate change into SHMPs, and increased climate change projection evidence was commonly cited as a driver of such integration. However, lack of funding and competing hazard mitigation priorities were the most commonly reported barriers to integration. Political prioritization was reported as both a barrier to and facilitator of integration. There is an ongoing need to effectively translate climate change research to practitioners to support evidence-based hazard mitigation policy and practice. © 2018 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Disasters; Emergency management; Hazard mitigation; Planning","adaptive management; catastrophic event; climate change; disaster management; drought; flood; hazard management; integrated approach; natural disaster; planning process; policy approach; prioritization; sea level change; survey method; vulnerability; wildfire; District of Columbia; United States","Errett, N.A.; Department of Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences, United States; email: nerrett@uw.edu",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056420186

In this chapter, we explore how dominant framings of scale have obscured and misconceived climate change action at the local and household. We then identify a range of simple evidence-based policy options for local government that demonstrate vast climate change mitigation potential. We show the major cumulative role that households have had in deploying solar PV energy across Australia.Finally, we note several examples that demonstrate the remarkable role that individuals can have in leveraging significant emissions reductions through advocacy and campaigning.

Pakistan is one of the most important South Asian countries and has been affected tremendously through several impacts namely; temperature rise, drought, pest-diseases, health issues, seasonal and lifestyle change and it has the potential to continue doing so in future. We conducted a survey to explore the adaptation and mitigation alertness to climate change among all provinces and areas (urban, peri-urban and rural) of Pakistan from general public since they are directly affected by climate change. In Pakistan, climate change is essentially caused by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the foremost sources of rise in the GHG emissions are human activities, such as deforestation and emissions from various sectors; transportation, industrialization, urbanization, waste, agriculture livestock & forestry and energy usage. All of these have a significant impact on climate change in all areas and provinces. The study determines that all the areas in Pakistan played an increased role in climate change, but rural, peri-urban, and small cities turned out to be in worst situation due to lack of attention and ignorance.

Climate change is projected to cause an increase in temperature, variations in rainfall, and an increase in frequency of extreme events such as heat, cold waves, frost days, droughts, floods, etc. Various plant processes like vegetative growth, flowering, fruiting and fruit quality are highly vulnerable to climate changes. Two major parameters of climate changes that have far reaching implications on plants are more erratic rainfall patterns and unpredictable high temperature spells which are consequently expected to reduce crop productivity. Drought reduced fruit set and increased fruit cracking in pomegranate and litchi. An increase in atmospheric temperature and change of rainfall pattern affected the banana cultivation in some countries. In various fruit crops, moisture stress and high temperature during flowering strongly influences the pollen and ovule quality and consequently the fruit set and yield. The promotion of stigma and stamen sterility in papaya is mainly because of the higher temperature, which caused flower drops as well as sex changes in female and hermaphrodite flowers. Flower drop is quite common in mango, guava, litchi and other fruits, if low temperature prevails during flowering. Studies have clearly shown that the population abundance, geographic range and pollination activities of important pollinator species like bees, moths, and butterflies are declining considerably with changing climate. Higher temperature during fruit growth and development increased the incidence of several physiological disorders like spongy tissue and black tip in mango, cracking of fruits, granulation in citrus, etc. Pest ecology of certain crops is changing due to climate change. Fruit fly in guava, carambola, citrus, etc. is becoming alarming due to hot and humid conditions. Warm and humid conditions are also favorable for pests like beetles, bugs and other sucking pests and diseases like mildew, blight, etc. Development of new varieties with higher yield potential and resistance to multiple stresses (drought, flood, salinity) should be the key to maintain yield. Improvement in germplasm of important tropical and subtropical fruit crops for heat stress tolerance should be one of the targets of breeding programs. Location specific soil and water conservation models, protocol for organic farming, conservation horticulture, development of biotic and abiotic stress tolerance rootstocks, etc., are some of the strategies to mitigate the impact of climate change.

The most recent international standard about carbon footprint, or CFP (ISO 14067), states that the soil C stocks change subsequently to crop management changes and should be included in CFP if not already calculated as part of land use change; although it can contribute considerably to the greenhouse gases (GHG) balance of food and bioenergy products, it is often disregarded in CFP studies. Four carbon footprint case studies in apricot, olive, grape and kiwifruit orchards, located in Southern Italy were analyzed. For each site two different management regimes were compared (conventional and sustainable managements), starting from 2013. The product system object of studies was the orchard, constituted by the trees and the soil. The boundaries of the study have been established for cradle to gate, which in the case of fruit production means from production of all productive inputs till the harvest of fruits in bins. The time boundaries corresponded to the life cycle of the orchards from establishment till removal (15-40 years). Inventory analysis was performed extensively in each farm. GHG emissions related to the production of productive inputs were retrieved mostly from the Ecoinvent database v.2.2 and v.3.0. Variation of soil C stock was assessed through Roth C model adapted to semi-arid climatic conditions and tree data by means of biomass measurements. The results showed that sustainable management of fruit orchards acted as “sink” while the conventional one acted as source for the carbon balance. The agro-ecosystem can produce a net benefit in terms of climate change mitigation, in case of well-done management, as demonstrated in the developed simulations of pilot orchards lifecycle. © 2018 International Society for Horticultural Science.

The vast majority of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are covered by GHG targets, but the precise number has been modified following these corrections, from 93% to 89% (and from 81% to 76% when excluding USA target). This corrigendum corrects the originally published paper to resolve three sets of inconsistencies. First, the abstract, key policy insights, main text and Figure 5(c) have been updated to ensure consistent treatment of GHG emissions covered by GHG targets. The bar graph in Figure 5(c) has been updated to include China’s non-CO2 emissions that are not part of their NDC target (plus other countries in a similar situation), correcting what was an underestimate of the GHG emissions not covered under the GHG targets. Such emissions are now accounted under category 3 (no target). Therefore, while the absolute coverage in categories 1 and 2 remains unchanged, their percentage shares have changed in the corrected paper. The percentage values of GHG emissions covered by GHG targets referred to in the abstract, key insights and the main text were based on the bar graph (Figure 5(c)) and, for this reason, have been amended in the corrected version of this publication, along with Figure 5(c). The graphical abstract remains unchanged as it already reflected the correct data. Second, due to rounding effects, the sum of subcategories (scores 1 and 2) stated in the text did not, in some cases, reflect the accurate value. All affected values have been updated to reflect correct rounding. Third, the legends of Figures 5, 6 and 9 were inconsistent with the figure titles and have been amended here. In addition, three values in the text were corrected and are now consistent with the graphical representation. The first value represented the share of countries assessed for energy efficiency targets (44% instead of 56%), the second value represented the share of GHG emissions covered by countries with energy efficiency targets (93% instead of 92%) and the third value represented the share of renewable energy targets in 2007 (39% instead of 40%). The specific changes are as follows: Abstract: The sentence ‘Key results show that national climate legislation and strategies witnessed a strong increase in the first half of the assessed decade, likely due to the political lead up to the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009, but have somewhat stagnated in recent years, currently covering 69% of global GHG emissions (almost 50% of countries).’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and now reads as ‘Key results show that national climate legislation and strategies witnessed a strong increase in the first half of the assessed decade, likely due to the political lead up to the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009, but have somewhat stagnated in recent years, currently covering 70% of global GHG emissions (almost 50% of countries).’ Furthermore, the sentence ‘In comparison, the coverage of GHG targets increased considerably in the run up to adoption of the Paris Agreement and 93% of global GHG emissions are currently covered by such targets.’ has been amended to reflect amendments made in Figure 5(c) (see below) and now reads as ‘In comparison, the coverage of GHG targets increased considerably in the run up to adoption of the Paris Agreement and 89% of global GHG emissions are currently covered by such targets.’Key policy insights: The sentence ‘The number of countries that have national legislation and strategies in place increased strongly up to 2012, but the increase has levelled off in recent years, now covering 69% of global emissions by 2017 (49% of countries and 76% of global population).’ has been amended to reflect two rounding errors and now reads as ‘The number of countries that have national legislation and strategies in place increased strongly up to 2012, but the increase has levelled off in recent years, now covering 70% of global GHG emissions by 2017 (48% of countries and 76% of global population).’ Similarly, the sentence ‘Economy-wide GHG reduction targets witnessed a strong increase in the build up to 2015 and are adopted by countries covering 93% of global GHG emissions (81% not counting USA) and 91% of global population (86% not counting USA) in 2017.’ has been amended to reflect amendments to Figure 5(c) and a rounding error and now reads as ‘Economy-wide GHG reduction targets witnessed a strong increase in the build up to 2015 and are adopted by countries covering 89% of global GHG emissions (76% not counting USA) and 90% of global population (86% not counting USA) in 2017.’Last paragraph on page 7: The sentence ‘Over Period I, 21% of countries (41 countries) with climate legislation or strategy increased to 43% (82 countries).’ was amended to ‘Over Period I, 21% of countries (41 countries) with climate legislation or strategy increased to 42% (82 countries).’ to reflect a rounding error. A footnote has been added after this sentence that states ‘Values provided in tables underneath the figures may not add up to the values in the text due to rounding.’ Furthermore, the sentence ‘Over period II, this number only increased modestly to 49% (94 countries).’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and now reads as ‘Over period II, this number only increased modestly to 48% (94 countries).’First paragraph on page 9: The sentence ‘While the number of countries with climate legislation or strategies in place by 2017 is limited (49%), the picture becomes more nuanced in terms of population and emissions covered (Figure 3(b,c)).’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and now reads as ‘While the number of countries with climate legislation or strategies in place by 2017 is limited (48%), the picture becomes more nuanced in terms of population and emissions covered (Figure 3(b,c)).’Second paragraph on page 9: The sentence ‘Thus, 76% of the global population and 69% of total GHG emissions were covered by legislation or strategies by 2017, with legislation alone covering a substantial 36% of the population and 44% of emissions (Figure 3(b,c)).’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and now reads as ‘Thus, 76% of the global population and 70% of total GHG emissions were covered by legislation or strategies by 2017, with legislation alone covering a substantial 36% of the population and 44% of emissions (Figure 3(b,c)).’Last paragraph on page 10: The sentence ‘Taken together, by 2017, these targets cover a substantial 91% of global population (dropping to 86% if USA’s NDC target is excluded5) and 93% of all global emissions (dropping to 81% if USA’s NDC target is excluded) (Figure 5(b,c)).’ has been amended to reflect changes in Figure 5(c) and a rounding error. The amended sentence now reads as ‘Taken together, by 2017, these targets cover a substantial 90% of global population (dropping to 86% if USA’s NDC target is excluded5) and 89% of all global emissions (dropping to 76% if USA’s NDC target is excluded) (Figure 5(b,c)).Figure 5(a–c) from page 11, Figure 6(a–c) from page 12 and Figure 9(a–c) from page 14: Legend items ‘2 Climate strategies and coordinating body’ and ‘1 Climate legislation’ have been amended to ‘2 Executive targets’ and ‘1 Legislative targets’, respectively.Figure 5(c) on page 11 was amended to include leftover global GHG emissions from countries that have GHG targets covering only CO2 or energy emissions, and not the entire economy and spectrum of GHGs. This figure has been updated from the previous publication version (here, Figure 1) to a new version (here, Figure 2) (including updated legend).Last paragraph on page 11: Sentence ‘However, in terms of population (28%) and GHG emissions (41%) covered, a much larger share of non-Annex I targets are legislative, reflecting the extent to which China’s actions affect the global aggregate data.’ has been amended to reflect changes caused by amendments to Figure 5(c) and now reads as ‘However, in terms of population (28%) and GHG emissions (38%) covered, a much larger share of non-Annex I targets are legislative, reflecting the extent to which China’s actions affect the global aggregate data.’First paragraph on page 14: Sentence ‘For example, in 2017, 97% of the citizens of the populous Asian region lived in a jurisdiction with a renewable energy/electricity target, of which 44% were governed by legislation mandating a target.’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and now reads as ‘For example, in 2017, 96% of the citizens of the populous Asian region lived in a jurisdiction with a renewable energy/electricity target, of which 44% were governed by legislation mandating a target.’First paragraph of Section 4.4, page 15: Sentence ‘However, these data are nonetheless worth exploring because the analysed sub-set of countries (44%) account for 77% of global population and 92% of emissions (Figures 9(b,c)).’ has been amended to reflect a subtraction error and now reads as ‘However, these data are nonetheless worth exploring because the analysed sub-set of countries (44%) account for 77% of global population and 93% of emissions (Figures 9(b,c)).’Second paragraph of Section 4.4, page 15: Sentences ‘By 2017, energy efficiency targets were adopted in 59 analysed countries, which amounts to 69% of countries for which energy efficiency target data were available and 31% of total countries studied. Of the 31% of countries reporting energy efficiency targets in 2017, only 6% of countries reported legislative targets, a proportion which actually declined from 14% in 2007.’ have been amended to reflect rounding errors and now read as ‘By 2017, energy efficiency targets were adopted in 59 analysed countries, which amounts to 69% of countries for which energy efficiency target data were available and 30% of total countries studied. Of the 30% of countries reporting energy efficiency targets in 2017, only 6% of countries reported legislative targets, a proportion which actually declined from 14% in 2007.’Last paragraph on page 15: The sentence ‘Furthermore, separation by Annexes also shows a high global coverage of energy efficiency targets: 94% of GHG emissions in Annex I countries and 60% in non-Annex I countries.’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and now reads as ‘Furthermore, separation by Annexes also shows a high global coverage of energy efficiency targets: 95% of GHG emissions in Annex I countries and 60% in non-Annex I countries.’Last paragraph of Section 4.5 on page 17: Final parenthesis ‘(as discussed above, this may be because energy efficiency targets are often set sectorally or locally, which is not captured here, and because the share of assessed countries for this indicator was low itself, 56%).’ has been amended to ‘(as discussed above, this may be because energy efficiency targets are often set sectorally or locally, which is not captured here, and because the share of assessed countries for this indicator was low itself, 44%).’ The correct value (44%) was provided in the first section of paragraph 4.4 and remains unchanged.First bullet point in conclusions on page 17: The sentence ‘By 2017, 69% of global GHG emissions (76% of the population and 49% of countries) are covered with either nationally binding climate legislation or climate strategies with a coordinating body.’ has been amended to reflect rounding errors and now reads as ‘By 2017, 70% of global GHG emissions (76% of the population and 48% of countries) are covered with either nationally binding climate legislation or climate strategies with a coordinating body.’Second bullet point in conclusions on page 17: The sentence ‘93% of global GHG emissions (81% without USA), (91% of global population (86% without USA) and 76% of countries (75% without USA) are today covered with national GHG emissions targets with a strong increase in 2015 from the development of NDCs under the Paris Agreement.’ has been amended to reflect a rounding error and amendments in Figure 5(c) and now reads as‘89% of global GHG emissions (76% without USA), 90% of global population (86% without USA) and 76% of countries (75% without USA) are today covered with national GHG emissions targets with a strong increase in 2015 from the development of NDCs under the Paris Agreement.’Third bullet point in conclusions on page 17: The sentence ‘Renewable energy targets saw a steady increase from 40% in 2007 to 87% of the population and 79% of emissions in 2017, with a particularly steep increase witnessed during the last few years in developing countries.’ has been amended to reflect an addition error and to enhance clarity, and now reads as ‘Renewable energy targets saw a steady increase from 39% of the population in 2007 to 87% in 2017, and from 45% of emissions in 2007 to 79% in 2017, with a particularly steep increase witnessed during the last few years in developing countries.’ (Figure presented.)

This paper analyses trends in adoption of national climate legislation and strategies, GHG targets, and renewable and energy efficiency targets in almost all UNFCCC Parties, focusing on the period from 2007 to 2017. The uniqueness and added value of this paper reside in its broad sweep of countries, the more than decade-long coverage and the use of objective metrics rather than normative judgements. Key results show that national climate legislation and strategies witnessed a strong increase in the first half of the assessed decade, likely due to the political lead up to the Copenhagen Climate Conference in 2009, but have somewhat stagnated in recent years, currently covering 70% of global GHG emissions (almost 50% of countries). In comparison, the coverage of GHG targets increased considerably in the run up to adoption of the Paris Agreement and 89% of global GHG emissions are currently covered by such targets. Renewable energy targets saw a steady spread, with 79% of the global GHG emissions covered in 2017 compared to 45% in 2007, with a steep increase in developing countries. Key policy insights The number of countries that have national legislation and strategies in place increased strongly up to 2012, but the increase has levelled off in recent years, now covering 70% of global emissions by 2017 (48% of countries and 76% of global population). Economy-wide GHG reduction targets witnessed a strong increase in the build up to 2015 and are adopted by countries covering 89% of global GHG emissions (76% not counting USA) and 90% of global population (86% not counting USA) in 2017. Renewable energy targets saw a steady increase throughout the last decade with coverage of countries in 2017 comparable to that of GHG targets. Key shifts in national measures coincide with landmark international events–an increase in legislation and strategy in the build-up to the Copenhagen Climate Conference and an increase in targets around the Paris Agreement–emphasizing the importance of the international process to maintaining national momentum. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The strategic assessment is immediately needed to provide project-level guidance for decision makers who will be required under new federal legislation to consider the extent to which each assessed project ""contributes to sustainability"" and ""hinders or contributes to"" meeting Canada's climate commitments. However, Canada, like many other countries, has not yet translated its Paris Agreement climate commitments into an adequate suite of specific policies, pathways, budgets, and other directives for compliance. Consequently, the climate commitments' strategic assessment will need to play a fully strategic role-in policy development as well as policy interpretation and elaboration for assessment purposes. This paper outlines the key considerations and required steps for a strategic assessment that fills the policy gap between Paris and projects, and develops guidance centred on a suite of tests for evaluating proposed major projects that may have important effects on Canada's prospects for meeting its climate commitments. © 2018 by the authors.","Canada; Climate change; Impact assessment; Law; Mitigation; Paris Agreement; Project assessment climate policy; Strategic assessment",,"Gibson, R.B.; School of Environment, Canada; email: rbgibson@uwaterloo.ca",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055118251

Marine vegetation (e.g. mangrove and seagrass meadows) is less than 0.5% of the total marine area and narrower compared to terrestrial vegetation. However, marine vegetation has high net primary production (NPP) and contributes more than 50% of the global carbon burial in its substrate and biomass. Indonesia has 3,301,848 ha of mangrove area, the widest in South-East Asia. The seagrass meadows of Indonesia are 150,693 ha, the second widest seagrass area in the world. These two ecosystems are important for the global carbon cycle due to their high capacity for carbon sequestration. Considering this potential, it is necessary to promote a strategic scientific-based policy of conservation of marine vegetation areas for both local and national stakeholders. The policies consist of: 1) to implement the National/Local Action Plan for Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions (RAN/D GRK); 2) to manage the land use changes that contribute 67% of total national emissions; 3) to determine coastal ecosystem protection areas that are considering the province policy in the Plan for Zoning of Coastal Areas and Small Islands (RZWP3K); 4) to rehabilitate terrestrial vegetation, coastal ecosystems, and aquatic conservation areas (President Regulation no 61/2011); and 5) to strictly carry out the national policy for green open space (Government Regulation no 26/2008). © 2018 Author(s).","carbon cycle; climate change; coastal; ecosystems; policy; terrestrial",,"Wahyudi, A.J.; Research Center for Oceanography, Jalan Pasir Putih 1, Indonesia; email: aanj001@lipi.go.id","Huyop F.Z.B.Siswanto D.Mastuti R.Treesubsuntorn C.","American Institute of Physics Inc.",0094243X,9780735417373,,,"English","AIP Conf.

Some scholars are concerned that policy discussions on adaptation might present climate change as a more manageable problem, and therefore crowd out mitigation efforts. On the other hand, providing information on adaptation costs may sensitize citizens to these costs, thereby increasing their willingness to support mitigation. To assess these conflicting predictions, we fielded a web-based survey experiment using a sample of 2,000 US-based respondents. We presented the respondents with a hypothetical newspaper article regarding a proposed gasoline tax (a mitigation strategy) and measured the support for this proposal across different treatment groups. In the control group, the respondents were told that failure to mitigate climate change could result in a potentially catastrophic outcome, whereas in each of the treatment groups the respondents were provided with information concerning possible adaptation costs. The respondents were then asked about their willingness to support a gasoline tax. Our key finding is that the provision of information about adaptation costs leads to a small increase in the respondents’ willingness to support mitigation efforts. Furthermore, we find that this effect becomes larger when the information regarding adaptation costs is made more specific. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Adaptation; climate change; gasoline tax; survey-based experiment",,"Greenhill, B.; Department of Political Science, 135 Western Avenue, Milne 212, United States; email: bgreenhill@albany.edu",,"Routledge",17524032,,,,"English","Env.

However, we lack an understanding of the effect of resource inequality when diverse actors interact together towards a common goal. Here, we report the results of a collective-risk dilemma experiment in which groups of individuals were initially given either equal or unequal endowments. We found that the effort distribution was highly inequitable, with participants with fewer resources contributing significantly more to the public goods than the richer -sometimes twice as much.

A literature review compiling carbon sequestration rates within key ecosystems confirms that blue carbon ecosystems are the most efficient natural carbon sinks at the plot scale, though some overlooked biogeochemical processes may lead to overestimation. Moreover, the limited spatial extent of coastal habitats minimizes their potential at the global scale, only buffering 0.42% of the global fossil fuel carbon emissions in 2014. Still, blue carbon plays a role for countries with moderate fossil fuel emissions and extensive coastlines. In 2014, mangroves mitigated greater than 1% of national fossil fuel emissions for countries such as Bangladesh, Colombia and Nigeria. Considering that the Paris Agreement is based on nationally determined contributions, we propose that mangrove blue carbon may contribute to climate change mitigation at this scale in some instances alongside other blue carbon ecosystems. © 2018 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

These targets serve as a spur for carbon mitigation initiatives, provide guidelines to select appropriate mitigation actions, and set the standards to measure the progress of the mitigation efforts. Despite their important functionalities, firm-level mitigation targets have rarely been studied. In this paper we aim to provide a comparative view on mitigation targets set by global firms across different countries and industrial sectors. The analysis focuses on four dimensions, i.e., adoption, metric, scope, and stringency. We find Japan far leads the other major countries in terms of target adoption, but the targets of Japanese firms are generally less stringent. Canadian firms are laggards in both target adoption and target stringency. The mitigation targets are also considerably uncommon among Australian firms. Firms in developing countries fall behind in target stringency and display a significantly greater divergence than developed countries in sectoral adoption rate. The European Union firms are most likely to cover the emissions in their supply chains in targets. Target stringency has substantially tightened from 2005 to 2012. For all the countries in this study, around 95% of the firm-level targets are more stringent than the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions submitted to the Paris Agreement. Setting mitigation target has a significant positive impact on both the likelihood of investing in renewable energy and the amount of investment in renewable energy. However, there is no evidence that more stringent targets lead to higher investment. These findings point to the most pressing issues with regard to corporate mitigation target-setting that policymakers and corporate management should address. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Developing countries; Firm; Mitigation target; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Carbon mitigation; Climate change mitigation; Corporate management; Developed countries; Firm; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Industrial sector; Renewable energies; Climate change","Wang, D.D.; Business School, 25 Xitucheng Road, China; email: derek.wang@mcgill.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048741897

In this paper, we study how management factors of a firm can shape the structure of its climate change mitigation technology portfolio. Based on a sample of 362 major firms in the United States for 2011–2013, we find delegating the responsibility of climate change to a position higher in firm hierarchy can promote the use of green design technology. The provision of monetary incentive to firm management contingent on climate change performance is positively associated with the portfolio size, and the use of pollution control and eco-efficiency technologies. Non-monetary incentive such as recognition is effective in stimulating the use of eco-efficiency technology. The firm's risk attitude towards climate change negatively affects the proportion of eco-efficiency technology in the portfolio. The results underscore that firms should take differential effects of management factors on technology portfolio into consideration when building the portfolio to attain desired economic and climate outcomes. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Incentive policy; Management factors; Risk; Technology management; Technology portfolio","Ecodesign; Pollution control; Risks; Climate change mitigation; Design technologies; Differential effect; Incentive policies; Low carbon energies; Management factors; Technology managements; Technology portfolios; Climate change","Wang, D.D.; Business School, 25 Xitucheng Road, China; email: derek.wang@mcgill.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

However, the effects of these mitigation policies have rarely been evaluated with respect to their influence on disadvantaged communities. Here we assess the air pollution and environmental justice implications of California's cap-and-trade mitigation program through analysis of (1) the sources of air pollution in disadvantaged communities, (2) emissions-reduction offset usage under the cap-and-trade program, and (3) the relationship between reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and reductions in co-pollutant emissions. Our analysis suggests that the cap-and-trade program has limited impacts, including limited disproportionate impacts, on air quality in disadvantaged communities. The sources of most air pollution in these communities have not been subject to the cap-and-trade program, and the use of emissions-reduction offsets is only marginally higher in disadvantaged communities than in other communities. Furthermore, reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply smaller proportional reductions in co-pollutant emissions. While climate policies lead to important air quality co-benefits in some contexts, especially through reduced coal usage, targeted air quality policies and regulations may be more effective for reducing air pollution in disadvantaged communities in California and throughout the state. © 2018 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Quality control; Air quality policy; Cap-and-trade program; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; Co-pollutants; Emissions reduction; Environmental justice; Mitigation policies; Climate change; air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; economic instrument; emission control; environmental justice; greenhouse gas; pollution policy; regulatory approach; air pollution; air quality; article; California; carbon footprint; climate change; human; justice; pollutant; California; climate change; greenhouse gas; particulate matter; California; United States; Air Pollution; California; Climate Change; Greenhouse Gases; Particulate Matter","Anderson, C.M.; Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, United States; email: andersn@stanford.edu",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"30179479","English","Environ.

Many climate change mitigation strategies have been evaluated in Mediterranean agroecosystems, including their soil organic carbon sequestration potential. High residue yielding old varieties could constitute a useful alternative, especially for organic farming, which lacks specific genetic material. In this study, old and modern wheat varieties were evaluated under organic (ORG) and conventional (CON) management during a 3-year field experiment under rainfed Mediterranean conditions. Field measurements of biomass components, literature emission factors, and soil organic carbon modeling were combined in an attributional Life Cycle Assessment, in order to estimate GHGe from “cradle to farm gate”. The resulting yield-based carbon footprints of old wheat varieties were significantly lower than those of modern varieties both under CON management, decreasing from 263 to 144 g CO2e kg−1, and under ORG management, decreasing from 29 to −43 g CO2e kg−1. Our results indicate that climate change mitigation strategies in Mediterranean rainfed cereal cropping systems should focus on diminishing GHGe from machinery and fertilizer use, and promoting carbon sequestration. The combination of organic management and old cereal varieties can constitute a promising climate change mitigation strategy in these systems, as low area-scaled GHGe of organic management are combined with enhanced carbon sequestration and a good yield performance of old varieties under these conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","C footprint; C sequestration; Greenhouse gases; Harvest index; Organic farming","Carbon footprint; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Machinery; Organic carbon; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; C sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Harvest index; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mediterranean agro-ecosystems; Organic farming; Soil organic carbon sequestration; Climate change","Carranza-Gallego, G.; Universidad Pablo de Olavide, Spain; email: gcargal@upo.es",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Our modeling frameworks include the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector, a framework for harvested wood products that estimates emissions based on product half-life decay times, and an account of marginal emission substitution benefits from the changes in use of wood products and bioenergy. Using a spatially explicit forest inventory with 16 ha pixels, we examine mitigation scenarios relating to forest management and wood use: increased harvesting efficiency; residue management for bioenergy; reduced harvest; reduced slashburning, and more longer-lived wood products. The primary reason for the spatially explicit approach at this coarse resolution was to estimate transportation distances associated with delivering harvest residues for heat and/or electricity production for local communities. Results: Results demonstrated large differences among alternative scenarios, and from alternative assumptions about substitution benefits for fossil fuel-based energy and products which changed scenario rankings. Combining forest management activities with a wood-use scenario that generated more longer-lived products had the highest mitigation potential. Conclusions: The use of harvest residues to meet local energy demands in place of burning fossil fuels was found to be an effective scenario to reduce GHG emissions, along with scenarios that increased the utilization level for harvest, and increased the longevity of wood products. Substitution benefits from avoiding fossil fuels or emissions-intensive products were dependent on local circumstances for energy demand and fuel mix, and the assumed wood use for products. As projected future demand for biomass use in national GHG mitigation strategies could exceed sustainable biomass supply, analyses such as this can help identify biomass sources that achieve the greatest mitigation benefits. © 2018 Crown Copyright.","CBM-CFS3; CBMF-HWP; Climate change mitigation scenario; Displacement factor; Forest sector; Spatially explicit","climate change; emission inventory; factor analysis; forest; forest inventory; greenhouse gas; management practice; mitigation; scenario analysis; spatial analysis; Canada","Smyth, C.E.; Natural Resources Canada, 506 Burnside Road West, Canada; email: Carolyn.Smyth@canada.ca",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17500680,,,,"English","Carbon Balance Manage.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053164335

The objective of this work was to evaluate forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios from 2018 to 2050 by applying a systems-based approach that accounts for net emissions across four interdependent components: (1) forest ecosystem, (2) land-use change, (3) harvested wood products, and (4) substitution benefits from using wood products and bioenergy. We assessed a range of land management and harvested wood product scenarios for two case studies in the U.S: coastal South Carolina and Northern Wisconsin. We integrated forest inventory and remotely-sensed disturbance data within a modelling framework consisting of a growth-and-yield driven ecosystem carbon model; a harvested wood products model that estimates emissions from commodity production, use and post-consumer treatment; and displacement factors to estimate avoided fossil fuel emissions. We estimated biophysical mitigation potential by comparing net emissions from land management and harvested wood products scenarios with a baseline ('business as usual') scenario. Results: Baseline scenario results showed that the strength of the ecosystem carbon sink has been decreasing in the two sites due to age-related productivity declines and deforestation. Mitigation activities have the potential to lessen or delay the further reduction in the carbon sink. Results of the mitigation analysis indicated that scenarios reducing net forest area loss were most effective in South Carolina, while extending harvest rotations and increasing longer-lived wood products were most effective in Wisconsin. Scenarios aimed at increasing bioenergy use either increased or reduced net emissions within the 32-year analysis timeframe. Conclusions: It is critical to apply a systems approach to comprehensively assess net emissions from forest sector climate change mitigation scenarios. Although some scenarios produced a benefit by displacing emissions from fossil fuel energy or by substituting wood products for other materials, these benefits can be outweighed by increased carbon emissions in the forest or product systems. Maintaining forests as forests, extending rotations, and shifting commodities to longer-lived products had the strongest mitigation benefits over several decades. Carbon cycle impacts of bioenergy depend on timeframe, feedstocks, and alternative uses of biomass, and cannot be assumed carbon neutral. © 2018 The Author(s).","CBM-CFS3; Climate change; Forest carbon; Greenhouse gas; Mitigation","assessment method; bioenergy; carbon sink; climate change; deforestation; displacement; forest ecosystem; forest inventory; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; growth; land management; land use change; landscape ecology; South Carolina; United States; Wisconsin","Dugan, A.J.; USDA Forest Service, 11 Campus Blvd, United States; email: adugan@fs.fed.us",,"BioMed Central Ltd.",17500680,,,,"English","Carbon Balance Manage.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053132876

In other words, in a carbon-based economy, causal responsibility for climate change is a byproduct of economic development, and is therefore endogenous to it. To capture this endogeneity, we combine these two dilemmas into a ‘compound climate dilemma’ and conduct a series of incentivized experiments in the United States and China to test its implications for cooperation and prosocial behaviour. Here we show that, in a differentiated development condition, even while the advantaged parties increase their prosociality relative to an endogenous but homogeneous baseline condition, the accompanying decrease in cooperative behaviour by the disadvantaged parties more than offsets it. Furthermore, compared with exogenous but identically parameterized control conditions, this endogeneity decreases cooperation in the mitigation dilemma. In light of this interdependence, the basis upon which mitigation obligations should be differentiated becomes an additional dimension of conflict, with implications for domestic politics and international negotiations discussed5,6. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"altruism; China; climate change; cooperation; economic development; economics; energy conservation; human; international cooperation; social responsibility; United States; Altruism; China; Climate Change; Conservation of Energy Resources; Cooperative Behavior; Economic Development; Humans; Internationality; Social Responsibility; United States","Kline, R.; Department of Political Science, United States; email: reuben.kline@stonybrook.edu",,"Nature Publishing Group",23973374,,,"31346284","English","Nat.

The socioeconomic and environmental benefits of replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy are complex; however, debate continues about issues such as best practices for biomass removal, stable supply chains, and GHG mitigation. With the greatest biomass per capita in the world, Canada could play an increasing role in the future of global bioenergy and the emerging bioeconomy. This paper reviews the utilization of feedstock salvaged after natural disturbances (fire and insect outbreaks) to supply wood-based bioenergy, by addressing the following multidisciplinary questions: (1) How much salvaged feedstock is available, and what are the uncertainties around these estimates? (2) How can sustainable practices to support increased removal of biomass be implemented? (3) What are the constraints on development of an integrated supply chain and cost-effective mobilization of the biomass? (4) Is the quality of biomass from salvaged trees suitable for conversion to bioenergy? (5) What is the potential for climate change mitigation? In average, salvaged feedstock from fire and insects could theoretically provide about 100 × 106 oven Dry ton (ODT) biomass per year, with high variability over time and space. Existing policies and guidelines for harvesting of woody biomass in Canadian jurisdictions could support sustainable biomass removal. However, uncertainties remain as to the development of competitive and profitable supply chains, because of the large distances between the locations of this feedstock and available processing sites. Another uncertainty lies in the time needed for a benefit in climate change mitigation to occur. A flexible supply chain, integrated with other sources of biomass residues, is needed to develop a cost-efficient bioenergy sector.

However, it has proven difficult to harness their full potential for climate change mitigation. Managed forests are often referred to as socio-ecological systems as the human dimension is an integral part of the system. When attempting to change systems that are influenced by factors such as collective knowledge, social organization, understanding of the situation and values represented in society, initial intentions often shift due to the complexity of political, social and scientific interactions. Currently, the scientific literature is dispersed over the different factors related to the socio-ecological system. To examine the level of dispersion and to obtain a holistic view, we review climate change mitigation in the context of Swedish forest research. We introduce a heuristic framework to understand decision-making connected to climate change mitigation. We apply our framework to two themes which span different dimensions in the socio-ecological system: carbon accounting and bioenergy. A key finding in the literature was the perception that current uncertainties regarding the reliability of different methods of carbon accounting inhibits international agreement on the use of forests for climate change mitigation. This feeds into a strategic obstacle affecting the willingness of individual countries to implement forest-related carbon emission reduction policies. Decisions on the utilization of forests for bioenergy are impeded by a lack of knowledge regarding the resultant biophysical and social consequences. This interacts negatively with the development of institutional incentives regarding the production of bioenergy using forest products. Normative disagreement about acceptable forest use further affects these scientific discussions and therefore is an over-arching influence on decision-making. With our framework, we capture this complexity and make obstacles to decision-making more transparent to enable their more effective resolution. We have identified the main research areas concerned with the use of managed forest in climate change mitigation and the obstacles that are connected to decision making. © 2018 The Authors","Adaptation; Forest industry; Forestry; Global change; Governance; Socio-ecological system","adaptive management; bioenergy; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; complexity; decision making; emission control; forest ecosystem; global change; governance approach; international agreement; pollution policy; strategic approach; Sweden","Klapwijk, M.J.; Ulls väg 16, 75651, Box 7044, Sweden; email: maartje.klapwijk@slu.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

As the country in the world with the largest cover of mangrove forest, Indonesia has global significance in climate change mitigation. About 22% of mangrove forests in Indonesia are preserved in conservation areas and provide 0.82–1.09 PgC hectare−1 of carbon storage. Greater potential for climate change mitigation can be achieved by increasing mangrove conservation areas that keep mangrove forests from their conversion to other land uses. Our finding confirms the importance of mangrove conservation in storing and sequestering carbon. Furthermore, as mangrove forests are associated with a diversity of ecosystem services with multiple beneficiaries, the carbon benefits will enhance the value of mangrove forest in terms of ecological, social, and economic benefits. However, prioritizing carbon benefits through the implementation of mangrove conservation as part of climate change mitigation may be conflicting with socioeconomic issues. Thus, legal frameworks and the participation of stakeholders, especially local communities, are needed to ensure that there is a net reduction in mangrove loss.

In this case study, corporate carbon footprint of a representative Turkish tanning company was analyzed. Inventory and impact data are presented to help in the environmental decision-making process. The results indicate that significant environmental impacts were caused during the landfilling of solid wastes as well as the production of the electricity and fuel required in the tannery. Turkish tannery inventory data presented here for the first time will be useful for leather tanning company managers to calculate sustainability key indicators. Improving alternatives at country level were identified (increasing the renewable sources on electricity production and promote energy recovery in landfills) which would be useful not only to decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of tanning sector but also of other industries requiring electricity and producing organic wastes. Considering the substantial contribution of industrial processes to the Turkish carbon emissions (15.7%) (TUIK, 2013), work done on those areas would provide a sound improvement in environmental profile of Turkey. The importance to promote a national strategy to reduce GHG emissions in Turkey was discussed here, as well as its relation to corporate carbon footprint assessments. One of the significant points revealed from the case study is the lack of published country specific emission factors for Turkey, which is a fundamental prerequisite to promote corporate carbon footprint assessment within the country. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Electricity mix; Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; Sustainable production; Turkish leather industry; Waste recycling","Climate change; Decision making; Electric power generation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Leather; Sustainable development; Tanning; Climate change mitigation; Electricity production; Environmental decision making; Environmental profile; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Leather industries; Sustainable production; Waste recycling; Carbon footprint; fuel; carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate change; decision making; environmental impact assessment; industrial waste; landfill; mitigation; recycling; solid waste; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; decision making; electricity; energy recovery; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse gas; landfill; leather industry; life cycle assessment; priority journal; renewable energy; solid waste; Turkey (republic); analysis; industrial waste; pollutant; turkey (bird); Turkey; Carbon Footprint; Climate Change; Environmental Pollutants; Industrial Waste; Solid Waste; Tanning; Turkey","Puig, R.; Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya (UPC), Spain; email: rita.puig@eei.upc.edu",,"Elsevier B.V.",00489697,,STEVA,"29660728","English","Sci.

India, as a developing country, has committed to reducing its emission intensity of GDP up to 30&thinsp;%-35&thinsp;% by 2030. The emission intense sectors would be targeted to achieve climate commitment. One of the emission intense sector is construction raw material manufacturing that contributes 10&thinsp;% share in the total emissions making it one of the potential mitigation sector. The study examines emissions from the construction raw materials namely, cement, steel, and brick manufacturing and presents two emission scenarios up to 2050. Energy efficient scenario (S2) is compared with a reference scenario (S1) developed based on a bottom-up approach. The results indicate that a moderate energy efficiency improvements and technological shifts lead to a decrease in emissions of 72&thinsp;MT&thinsp;CO2 by 2030 and 137&thinsp;MT&thinsp;CO2 by 2050. Further, the steel industry has the highest reduction potential, as the current technologies are energy inefficient. Similarly, the current dependency on fired bricks may be shifted to cement setting blocks leading to emission reductions. Cement manufacturing, on the other hand, shows limited scope for emission reduction that may be achieved through energy efficiency improvements. Efforts towards energy efficiency improvements in construction raw material manufacturing would result in reductions beyond the existing commitment of the Paris Agreement for India by 2030. © Author(s) 2018.",,"climate change; construction industry; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental economics; Gross Domestic Product; manufacturing; India","Jajal, P.; Interdisciplinary Programme in Climate Studies, India; email: jajal.priyanka@gmail.com",,"Copernicus GmbH",16807340,,,,"English","Adv.

We combined large-scale databases available for continental Spain on: (1) distribution of breeding birds, (2) forest inventory stands, (3) land-use cover, (4) 18 global climate models recently developed at local scales, and (5) historical and genetically-based information on the distribution of natural versus planted pine forests, to analyze whether back to nature strategies may help to mitigate biodiversity loss due to climate change. We performed the analysis along environmental and ecological gradients of pine forests in Southern Europe. Models suggested that, naturalization strategies, in this case defined by the replacement of planted pine forests and eucalyptus forests by natural pine forests, could help to mitigate the expected loss of bird diversity due to climate change, but that mitigation efficiency will vary along environmental and ecological gradients. Maximum levels of diversity mitigation were predicted at intermediate levels of naturalization, with lower bird richness in areas where all pine forests were either planted or naturalized. Efficiency also varied spatially, given that both cold- and hot-spots of climate-driven bird diversity loss were identified. Transforming planted forest into natural forest is not a mitigation panacea, and additional regionally-adapted strategies may be identified to mitigate the expected biodiversity loss in forest ecosystems. © 2018 Martínez-Jauregui et al.

Emissions from deforestation are acknowledge as the second biggest cause of greenhouse gas emissions, accounting for up to 20% of CO2 equivalent released into the atmosphere in 2010. One of the main strategies internationally adopted to reduce deforestation and forest degradation, which is now gaining importance for the climate change mitigation, is the implementation of protected areas. The current paradigm of protected area management is based on market instruments, exemplified by the REDD + initiatives and payment for ecosystem services schemes. However, critics of this perspective argue that it is directly influenced by neoliberalism and privileges capital accumulation over the conservation of the environment. Through a critical analysis of the existing literature, the present article suggests that protected areas are an efficient strategy for reducing deforestation, but it is still insufficient and needs to be accompanied by complementary actions for the control of territories outside protected areas, which prevents the redirection of illegal activities. © 2018 Universidade Federal do Parana.

However, efforts to mitigate climate change through comprehensive, economy-wide GHG emissions reductions may also negatively affect food security, due to indirect impacts on prices and supplies of key agricultural commodities4–6. Here we conduct a multiple model assessment on the combined effects of climate change and climate mitigation efforts on agricultural commodity prices, dietary energy availability and the population at risk of hunger. A robust finding is that by 2050, stringent climate mitigation policy, if implemented evenly across all sectors and regions, would have a greater negative impact on global hunger and food consumption than the direct impacts of climate change. The negative impacts would be most prevalent in vulnerable, low-income regions such as sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where food security problems are already acute. © 2018, The Author(s).",,,"Hasegawa, T.; Center for Social and Environmental Systems Research, Japan; email: hasegawa.tomoko@nies.go.jp",,"Nature Publishing Group",1758678X,,,,"English","Nat.

Coalition formation is gauged through clustering analysis on multiple factors including natural, economic, and social factors, RCPs, and other aspects. Projected emission is found to be the main determinant in forming coalitions, and the USA, EU, China + India, and the rest of the world constitute the four-coalition configuration that is stable across different scenarios. Under this base configuration, the Regional Integrated Climate-Economy model for Coalition Game model is implemented to assess the sensitivity of equilibrium solutions to parameter uncertainties, sanctions on non-mitigation, and adjustments in coalition composition. The main conclusion of the game simulations is that no coalition would adopt a mitigation strategy at the Nash equilibrium if no penalty is in place. The Nash equilibrium remains stable even when the climatic and economic parameters are disturbed. As an alternative to the conventional game, an external sanction is imposed on coalitions that choose not to mitigate climate change; in this scenario, climate change mitigation propagates across coalitions according to various sanction levels. The paper also shows that a social welfare compensation between two coalitions may alter the equilibrium game strategy depending on whether the compensation outweighs the welfare loss from mitigation. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate coalition; Coalition formation; Mitigation game; Nash equilibrium","climate change; cluster analysis; game theory; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation; negotiation process; parameterization; policy implementation; prediction; strategic approach; China; Europe; India; United States","Thill, J.-C.; Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, United States; email: jfthill@uncc.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",15679764,,,,"English","Int.

These regimes have a strong influence on the life history of most aquatic river species, and are key variables controlling the growth and survival of Atlantic salmon. This study explores how the future abundance of Atlantic salmon may be influenced by climate-induced changes in water temperature and discharge in a regulated river, and investigates how negative impacts in the future can be mitigated by applying different regulated discharge regimes during critical periods for salmon survival. A spatially explicit individual-based model was used to predict juvenile Atlantic salmon population abundance in a regulated river under a range of future water temperature and discharge scenarios (derived from climate data predicted by the Hadley Centre's Global Climate Model (GCM) HadAm3H and the Max Plank Institute's GCM ECHAM4), which were then compared with populations predicted under control scenarios representing past conditions. Parr abundance decreased in all future scenarios compared to the control scenarios due to reduced wetted areas (with the effect depending on climate scenario, GCM, and GCM spatial domain). To examine the potential for mitigation of climate change-induced reductions in wetted area, simulations were run with specific minimum discharge regimes. An increase in abundance of both parr and smolt occurred with an increase in the limit of minimum permitted discharge for three of the four GCM/GCM spatial domains examined. This study shows that, in regulated rivers with upstream storage capacity, negative effects of climate change on Atlantic salmon populations can potentially be mitigated by release of water from reservoirs during critical periods for juvenile salmon. © 2018","Climate scenarios; Hydropower regulation; Individual-based modelling; Mitigation; Population abundance; Salmonids","Climate models; Digital storage; Population statistics; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Temperature; Wetting; Climate scenarios; Hydropower regulation; Individual-based modelling; Mitigation; Population abundance; Salmonids; Climate change; abundance; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; hydroelectric power; individual-based model; regulatory approach; river discharge; salmonid; water temperature; Article; biological model; climate change; computer simulation; controlled study; environmental impact; environmental parameters; freshwater fish; global climate; Hadley Center Global Climate Model; hydraulic model; hydrological model; hydropower; hydropower production model; juvenile animal; nonbiological model; nonhuman; population abundance; prediction; priority journal; river; river carrying capacity; Salmo salar; Salmo trutta; seasonal variation; summer; survival; temperature dependence; water cycle; water temperature; wetland; animal; ecosystem restoration; environmental monitoring; physiology; procedures; Salmo salar; theoretical model; Salmo salar; Salmonidae; Animals; Climate Change; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Models, Theoretical; Rivers; Salmo salar","Sundt-Hansen, L.E.; Norwegian Institute for Nature Research, P.O.

This paper focuses on the potential climate mitigation by behavioural change in the European Union (EU) covering many behavioural options in food, mobility and housing demand which do not require any personal up-front investment. We use the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), capturing both their direct and indirect implications in terms of greenhouse gas emissions. Our results indicate that modest to rigorous behavioural change could reduce per capita footprint emissions by 6 to 16%, out of which one fourth will take place outside the EU, predominantly by reducing land use change. The domestic emission savings would contribute to reduce the costs of achieving the internationally agreed climate goal of the EU by 13.5 to 30%. Moreover, many of these options would also yield co-benefits such as monetary savings, positive health impacts or animal wellbeing. These results imply the need for policymakers to focus on climate education and awareness programs more seriously and strategically, making use of the multiple co-benefits related with adopting pro-environmental behaviour. Apart from that, the relevance of behavioural change in climate change mitigation implies that policy-informing models on climate change should include behavioural change as a complement or partial alternative to technological change. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Behavioural change; Climate change; Diet change; Footprint emissions; Land-use change; Mitigation; Mobility; Policy costs; Waste recycling","behavioral response; carbon footprint; climate change; cost analysis; diet; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; global change; greenhouse gas; international agreement; investment; land use change; mitigation; recycling; social mobility; technological change; waste disposal; Animalia","van de Ven, D.-J.; Basque Centre for Climate Change (BC3), Edificio Sede 1-1, Parque Científico de UPV/EHU, Barrio Sarriena s/n, Spain; email: dj.vandeven@bc3research.org",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

Uncertainty in global climate change should be considered in any decision-making processes for flood mitigation strategies, especially in areas within a monsoon climate regime. This study applied a novel planning method called real option analysis (ROA) to an important water resources planning practice in Korea. The proposed method can easily be applied to other watersheds that are threatened by flood risk under climate change. ROA offers flexibility for decision-makers to reflect uncertainty at every stage during the project planning period. We successfully implemented ROA using a binomial tree model, including two real options—delay and abandon—to evaluate flood mitigation alternatives for the Yeongsan River Basin in Korea. The priority ranking of the four alternatives between the traditional discount cash flow (DCF) and ROA remained the same; however, two alternatives that were assessed as economically infeasible using DCF, were economically feasible using ROA. The binomial decision trees generated in this study are expected to be informative for decision-makers to conceptualize their adaptive planning procedure. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Flood mitigation; Real option analysis; Uncertainty; Water resources planning","action plan; adaptive management; basin management; climate change; conceptual framework; decision making; environmental planning; flood control; planning practice; risk assessment; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; water planning; water resource; watershed; South Korea; Youngsan River","Seo, S.B.; Institute of Engineering Research, South Korea; email: sbseo7@snu.ac.kr",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

This paper examines urban residents’ awareness and concern about climate change and their autonomous behaviour and mitigation measures in the coastal city of Mombasa through a survey of 290 subjects. The study established that most (96.6%) residents of the city are aware that climate change is taking place and link its causes mainly on deforestation, fuel combustion and nature but less to household activities and poor waste disposal. Although they were able to identify its consequences as an increase in average temperature, occurrence of infectious diseases and flooding, there are certain misconceptions such as ozone layer depletion (67.6%) and earthquake/ tremor (12.1%). The study established that a number of residents affirmed some autonomous adaptive behaviour such as staying indoors during extreme temperatures and having an emergency kit at home. The results of the study demonstrate that awareness and concern about climate change had strongest effect on reduced energy consumption at home, and that the strongest barrier to taking mitigation steps is lack of necessary skills. The study concludes by recommending sensitization of urban public on the negative contributions of household activities and poor waste disposal to the concentration of greenhouse gases and the need to focus campaigns on personal mitigation activities. © 2018 Society of South African Geographers.","Adaptive behaviour; Climate change awareness; Mitigation; Mombasa City; Urban residents","climate change; coastal zone; deforestation; energy use; environmental planning; fitness; resident population; urban society; Kenya; Mombasa [Kenya]; Mombasa [Mombasa (CNT)]","Okaka, F.O.; Post-Doctoral Research Fellow, Private Bag, X5050, South Africa; email: fredrickokaka@gmail.com",,"Routledge",03736245,,,,"English","S.

In parallel, to assess the effect of the land use change (LUC) from cropland to pasture, a series of pastures established on former agricultural sites, abandoned at different time in the past, were also investigated. Our results show that woody encroachment on former pastures and croplands contributes largely to mitigate climate change, with an increase of the original SOC stock of 45% (40.5 Mg C ha−1) and 120% (66.5 Mg C ha−1), respectively. Also the LUC from croplands to pastures, greatly contributes to climate change mitigation trough a SOC increase of about 80% of the original SOC (45.9 Mg C ha−1). The management of abandoned lands represent a crucial point in the mitigation potential of agriculture and forestry activities, and particularly the role of the SOC pool. A policy effort should focus on minimizing the risk of speculative management options, particularly when the value of woody biomass become convenient to supply new energy systems allowing monetizing a long term forests productivity. In conclusion, despite both the land abandonment and the LUC can have a different impact on the SOC pool under different climatic conditions, these results can be useful to improve the SOC estimates in the National greenhouse gases Inventory at country level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",,"organic carbon; carbon; abandoned land; adaptive management; biological invasion; broad-leaved forest; climate change; land use change; organic carbon; soil carbon; woody plant; Article; bulk density; chronosequence; climate change; controlled study; cropland; environmental policy; forestry; greenhouse gas; Italy; land use; pasture; precipitation; productivity; rural area; soil analysis; urbanization; agriculture; soil; Italy; Mediterranean Region; Agriculture; Carbon; Climate Change; Italy; Soil","Tommaso, C.; Department for Innovation in Biological, via San C.

This can increase food prices, and hence raises food security concerns. Here we show how an inclusive policy design can avoid these adverse side-effects. Food-security support through international aid, bioenergy tax, or domestic reallocation of income can shield impoverished and vulnerable people from the additional risk of hunger that would be caused by the economic effects of policies narrowly focussing on climate objectives only. In the absence of such support, 35% more people might be at risk of hunger by 2050 (i.e. 84 million additional people) in a 2◦C-consistent scenario. The additional global welfare changes due to inclusive climate policies are small (0.1%) compared to the total climate mitigation cost (3.7% welfare loss), and the financial costs of international aid amount to about half a percent of high-income countries' GDP. This implies that climate policy should treat this issue carefully.

This emerging configuration of social forces makes the need for deep social reforms through redistribution, recognition, restitution, regeneration and resistance–book-ended by the twin principles of ‘maximum land size’ (‘size ceiling’) and a ‘guaranteed minimum land access’ (‘size floor’)–both more compelling and urgent, and, at the same time, more difficult than ever before. The five deep social reforms of socially just land policy are necessarily intertwined. But the global land rush amidst deepening climate change calls attention to the linkages, especially between the pursuit of agrarian justice on the one hand and climate justice on the other. Here, the relationship is not without contradictions, and warrants increased attention as both unit of analysis and object of political action. Understanding and deepening agrarian justice imperatives in climate politics, and understanding and deepening climate justice imperatives in agrarian politics, is needed more than ever in the ongoing pursuit of alternatives. © 2018, © 2018 Southseries Inc., www.thirdworldquarterly.com.","Cambodia; climate change; Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA); Land politics; land rush; Myanmar","adaptive management; agrarian reform; agri-environmental policy; climate change; mitigation; policy approach; social justice; Cambodia; Myanmar","Borras, S.M.; International Institute of Social Studies - ISSNetherlands; email: borras@iss.nl",,"Routledge",01436597,,,,"English","Third World Q.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046011995

Climate change’s effects on natural disasters can be expected to induce a rise in humanitarian crises. In addition, it will surely impact the population’s long-term general health, especially among the most fragile. There are foreseeable health risks that both ambulatory care organizations and hospitals will face as global temperatures rise. These risks include the geographic redistribution of infectious (particularly zoonotic) diseases, an increase in cardiac and respiratory illnesses, as well as a host of other health hazards. Some of these risks have been detailed for most developed countries as well as for some developing countries. Using these existing risk assessments as a template, organizational innovations as well as implementation strategies should be proposed to mitigate the disruptive effects of these health risks on emergency departments and by extension, reduce the negative impact of climate change on the populations they serve. © 2018 by the authors.

First, we provide a brief overview of research on domestic energy use, covering four main disciplines: engineering, economics, psychology, and sociology. We then discuss the results of empirical studies that examine how households may be encouraged to reduce their energy use and help mitigate climate change. We include research findings in three key areas: technological innovations, economic incentives, and informational interventions. We outline the effectiveness of each of these approaches in encouraging domestic energy conservation and provide instances where such approaches have not been effective. Building on this established body of knowledge on direct energy consumption (i.e., electricity, gas, and fuel consumption), we highlight applications for addressing indirect energy consumption (i.e., energy embedded in the products households consume) by discussing its implications for sustainable food consumption as a climate mitigation option. We conclude this overview by outlining how research from the four disciplines might be better integrated in future research to advance domestic energy conservation theory and empirical studies.

Nat Clim Chang 5:1014–1020, 2015). It is reasoned that increased public awareness and perceived threat of climate change may pressure governments to enact policy to counteract climate change (e.g. setting stringent carbon emissions targets). Despite a logical link between public awareness and government-set emissions targets, this relationship remains untested. We examined the relationship between public awareness about and perceived threat of climate change and governmental emissions targets across 71 countries and 1 region. We found a positive association between the proportions of a country’s population that are aware of climate change and the unconditional emissions reduction targets set by that country in the Paris Agreement (Rogelj et al. Nature 534:631–639, 2016). However, the proportion of people in a country who perceive climate change as a personal threat was not associated with higher emissions reduction targets.

However, the carbon uptake potential in land-based climate change mitigation efforts is highly uncertain. Here, we address this uncertainty by using two land-based mitigation scenarios from two land-use models (IMAGE and MAgPIE) as input to four dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs; LPJ-GUESS, ORCHIDEE, JULES, LPJmL). Each of the four combinations of land-use models and mitigation scenarios aimed for a cumulative carbon uptake of ~130 GtC by the end of the century, achieved either via the cultivation of bioenergy crops combined with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) or avoided deforestation and afforestation (ADAFF). Results suggest large uncertainty in simulated future land demand and carbon uptake rates, depending on the assumptions related to land use and land management in the models. Total cumulative carbon uptake in the DGVMs is highly variable across mitigation scenarios, ranging between 19 and 130 GtC by year 2099. Only one out of the 16 combinations of mitigation scenarios and DGVMs achieves an equivalent or higher carbon uptake than achieved in the land-use models. The large differences in carbon uptake between the DGVMs and their discrepancy against the carbon uptake in IMAGE and MAgPIE are mainly due to different model assumptions regarding bioenergy crop yields and due to the simulation of soil carbon response to land-use change. Differences between land-use models and DGVMs regarding forest biomass and the rate of forest regrowth also have an impact, albeit smaller, on the results. Given the low confidence in simulated carbon uptake for a given land-based mitigation scenario, and that negative emissions simulated by the DGVMs are typically lower than assumed in scenarios consistent with the 2°C target, relying on negative emissions to mitigate climate change is a highly uncertain strategy. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","avoided deforestation and afforestation; BECCS; carbon dioxide removal; land-based mitigation; negative emissions","afforestation; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop yield; deforestation; emission; land use change; nutrient uptake; uncertainty analysis; carbon; carbon dioxide; biomass; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; crop; environmental protection; forest; metabolism; soil; uncertainty; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Forests; Soil; Uncertainty","Krause, A.; Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany; email: andreas.krause@kit.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",13541013,,,"29569788","English","Global Change Biol.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045380104

Grey relational model is employed to verify the relationships between renewable energy and its drivers. The results of the forecasts reveal the challenges of long-term deployment for renewable energy technologies. Other results show that during the research period, energy security makes a major contribution to renewable energy development.

This is particularly true in China, a large and economically diverse country that has rapidly industrialized and urbanized and that has pledged under the Paris Agreement that its emissions will peak by 2030. We present new, city-level estimates of CO2 emissions for 182 Chinese cities, decomposed into 17 different fossil fuels, 46 socioeconomic sectors, and 7 industrial processes. We find that more affluent cities have systematically lower emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP), supported by imports from less affluent, industrial cities located nearby. In turn, clusters of industrial cities are supported by nearby centers of coal or oil extraction. Whereas policies directly targeting manufacturing and electric power infrastructure would drastically undermine the GDP of industrial cities, consumption-based policies might allow emission reductions to be subsidized by those with greater ability to pay. In particular, sector-based analysis of each city suggests that technological improvements could be a practical and effective means of reducing emissions while maintaining growth and the current economic structure and energy system. We explore city-level emission reductions under three scenarios of technological progress to show that substantial reductions (up to 31%) are possible by updating a disproportionately small fraction of existing infrastructure.

Recent evaluations from the USA and the European Union (EU) indicate that the setting of minimum mandatory energy performance standards (MEPS) for different products-such as electric motors, TVs, and dishwashers-are among the best-performing climate policies and that these regulations are also cost-effective. In the EU, MEPS are adopted under the Ecodesign Directive. Despite the positive evaluations, MEPS have also come under criticism from media and some researchers, questioning their unintended effects and their cost-effectiveness. This chapter reflects the research of a five-year, interdisciplinary research program (2013-2018) which researched the effects and potential of the Ecodesign Directive. Multiple methods were employed in the project, which have resulted in various insights. The aim of this chapter is to discuss the main experiences with this interdisciplinary research project, including the variety of research methods, the ways the results have been communicated to policymakers and other actors outside academia, and the need for future research to better understand the interactions between resource efficiency and climate mitigation in the context of product regulation. Two issues of high importance in the climate change mitigation research arena are highlighted. The first issue concerns the need for research that looks at interactions between energy efficiency and resource efficiency in the case of MEPS, and the need to develop new methods and approaches. Secondly, in the case of the ""policy mix"" for effective climate mitigation, there is a need to develop new theories, and also to consider the political feasibility of proposed policies. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

In Malawi, emphasis has been on creating messages without regard to the effect the language being used may have, thus resulting in misrepresentation and misunderstanding of the concepts and facts. This paper argues that the use of language of sustainability can be a critical factor in attainment of climate change mitigation. This paper draws its conclusions from the first stage of the research project which was aimed at examining the language used in the climate change mitigation project in Mulanje district and its impact on citizen participation in climate change mitigation projects. It was demonstrated that there is disconnection in the contextualisation of the language as it does not reflect the everyday use of the language by the local communities in the project area. This paper suggests that language must be reprocessed to meet the expectations of the local communities and must be contextually appropriate to the context of situation in which the discourse is taking place. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

The purpose of this paper is to assess the behavioural approaches of rural women farmers to adaptation measures of climate change in Abia State, Nigeria. Specifically, this paper ascertains perceived effects of climate change in the study area and adaptation measures practised by the women in the study area and identifies farmers' behavioural responses to adaptation measures to climate change and factors that influence farmers' behavioural approach to adaptation measures to climate change in the study area. Multistage sampling techniques were used in selecting 180 respondents for the study. Descriptive statistics was used for data analysis, while Tobit regression model and Pearson's correlation were used to test the hypotheses. Results show that high sunshine intensity, increased drought, inadequate access to water and crop losses are major perceived changes to climate change, while change of planting time (x = 4:79), enterprise diversification (x = 4:51) and crop rotation (x = 4:22) are major adaptation measures practised by the women in the study area. Seeking for information based on observed changes (x = 5:00), reverting to indigenous or self-help methods and changing cropping style and time (x = 3:41) were identified as major behavioural responses of the women to climate change, while Tobit regression result indicated that age (-2.795**), household size (2.705**), level of education (3.389***) and income (2.505**) were major factors that influence the women farmers' behavioural approach to adaptation measures to climate change in the study area. Pearson's correlation analysis shows that there is a significant relationship between the women's behavioural responses to adaptation measures to climate change and adoption of adaptation measures by the women. The study has examined and shown the women's level of conformity, constraints and factors that influence their adoption of adaptation and mitigation strategies in the study area. It is therefore recommended among others that targeted and timely information be provided to the women through agricultural extension and mass media, the most effective and sustainable indigenous technologies used by the farming communities could be incubated with a view to upscale and out scale them in other to enhance adaptation to climate change and variability by the resource-poor farmers. ICT-driven virtual platform that provides weather advisory services for small-scale farmers should be made available through rural advisory services (RAS). This will help farmers handle climate risk situation promptly. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.

The climate change mitigation policies include carbon tax, emission trading, renewable portfolio standard, feed-in tariff, and renewable fuel standard. The total marginal effect of inequality on CO2 emission is divided into direct, indirect, and interaction effects. Results show that high-income inequality directly raises CO2 emission while indirectly reducing it through its impact on economic growth. Inequality weakens the effectiveness of certain climate change mitigation policies through an interaction effect between inequality and climate change mitigation policies. Whether inequality increases CO2 emission or vice versa cannot be confirmed from the empirical outcomes of total marginal effects of inequality on CO2 emission under different climate change mitigation policies.

This paper presents a set of alternative scenarios by five global climate and agro-economic models. Covering integrated assessment (IMAGE), partial equilibrium (CAPRI, GLOBIOM, MAgPIE) and computable general equilibrium (MAGNET) models ensures a good coverage of biophysical and economic agricultural features. These models are harmonized with respect to basic model drivers, to assess the range of potential impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector by 2050. Moreover, they quantify the economic consequences of stringent global emission mitigation efforts, such as non-CO2 emission taxes and land-based mitigation options, to stabilize global warming at 2 °C by the end of the century under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. A key contribution of the paper is a vis-à-vis comparison of climate change impacts relative to the impact of mitigation measures. In addition, our scenario design allows assessing the impact of the residual climate change on the mitigation challenge. From a global perspective, the impact of climate change on agricultural production by mid-century is negative but small. A larger negative effect on agricultural production, most pronounced for ruminant meat production, is observed when emission mitigation measures compliant with a 2 °C target are put in place. Our results indicate that a mitigation strategy that embeds residual climate change effects (RCP2.6) has a negative impact on global agricultural production relative to a no-mitigation strategy with stronger climate impacts (RCP6.0). However, this is partially due to the limited impact of the climate change scenarios by 2050. The magnitude of price changes is different amongst models due to methodological differences.

Significant weather aberrations in form of the uneven precipitation pattern, more frequent and intense occurrence of temperature fluctuations accompanied by changes in wind intensity and frequency, amount of clouds, intensity and quality of sunlight can be expected. Maybe the most vulnerable sector affected by CC is agriculture. So, it is important to mitigate and adapt to a new situation through different and most adaptable agricultural strategies. Accordingly, scientists, experts, politicians, decision-makers, and others increasingly emphasize the need for further development of sustainable agricultural production, whose management will be compatible with different ecosystems (agroecosystem compliance with global ecosystems), while simultaneously restoring degraded agricultural land. One of the best solutions for sustainable agricultural production, under CC conditions, can be Conservation agriculture. Climate change is not only an abstraction, which is why one of the most important roles of conservation agriculture today is its ability to adapt and mitigate these changes. The basis of conservation agriculture production is in management set on three fundamental postulates, which contextually unify climate-soil-plant, while respecting agroecological and socio-economic differences. © 2018, Faculty of Agriculture in Osijek.

Here we expand the existing research with a review of potential mitigation opportunities across the entire food system, including in pre-production, production, processing, transport, consumption and loss and waste. We detail and synthesize recent research on the topic, and explore the applicability of different climate mitigation strategies in varying country contexts with different economic and agricultural systems. Further, we highlight some potential adaptation co-benefits of food system mitigation strategies and explore the potential implications of such strategies on food systems as a whole. We suggest that a food systems research approach is greatly needed to capture such potential synergies, and highlight key areas of additional research including a greater focus on low- and middle-income countries in particular. We conclude by discussing the policy and finance opportunities needed to advance mitigation strategies in food systems.

It has particular relevance in regions such as Andalusia (southern Spain) where olive growing is a key land use activity with significant social, economic and environmental implications. This potential of olive farming, however, is not adequately embodied in current Agri-Environmental Climate Schemes (AECS), which often fail to deliver the expected outcomes. The present article proposes an alternative strategy based on a result-oriented approach to AECS for enhancing soil carbon sequestration in Andalusian olive growing. After reviewing the current legal and institutional situation which forbids the wide application of result-oriented agri-environmental schemes, we suggest the use of alternative territorial governance arrangements, such as hybrid governance structures (HGS), as a framework to support the implementation of a result-oriented approach in the specific case of olive growing. Results indicate that the application of HGS can provide valuable benefits in terms of soil carbon storage. The information provided may be useful in the proposed new legislative framework, at both European and regional level, to promote more sustainable farming systems. © The Author(s) 2018.","Agri-environmental policy instruments; Carbon sequestration; Common Agricultural Policy; Hybrid governance structures; Mediterranean agri-environmental systems; Olive cultivation",,"Colombo, S.; Department of Agricultural Economics, Camino de Purchil s/n, Spain; email: sergio.colombo@juntadeandalucia.es",,"SAGE Publications Inc.",00307270,,,,"English","Outlook Agric.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045630970

The US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA in Climate change: long-term trends and their implications for emergency management, 2011. https://www.fema.gov/pdf/about/programs/oppa/climate_change_paper.pdf) has issued a policy directive to integrate climate change adaptation actions into hazard mitigation programs, policies, and plans. However, to date there has been no comprehensive empirical study to examine the extent to which climate change issues are integrated into state hazard mitigation plans (SHMPs). This study develops 18 indicators to examine the extent of climate change considerations in the 50 SHMPs. The results demonstrate that these SHMPs treat climate change issues in an uneven fashion, with large variations present among the 50 states. The overall plan quality for climate change considerations was sustained at an intermediate level with regard to climate change-related awareness, analysis, and actions. The findings confirm that climate change concepts and historic extreme events have been well recognized by the majority of SHMPs. Even though they are not specific to climate change, mitigation and adaptation strategies that can help reduce climate change risks have been adopted in these plans. However, the plans still lack a detailed assessment of climate change and more incentives for collaboration strategies beyond working with emergency management agencies. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Action; Adaptation; Analysis; Awareness; Climate change; Mitigation; State hazard mitigation plan (SHMP)","adaptive management; climate change; disaster management; hazard management; mitigation; natural hazard; policy approach; strategic approach; United States","Tang, Z.; Community and Regional Planning Program, 313 Architecture Hall, United States; email: ztang2@unl.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",0921030X,,,,"English","Nat.

Debates on climate change advocate that urban areas not only contribute to climate change by emitting huge amounts of carbon dioxide gas into the atmosphere, but also play a vital role in addressing climate change. In the context of rapidly evolving policy frameworks in India, this research assessed whether urban planning policies in master plans target climate change mitigation. The research undertook a quantitative and qualitative content analysis of the policy framework of sampled master plans and developed climate change mitigation indexes by assessing urban policies against climate change mitigation evaluation protocols. Results derived from the climate change mitigation index-consisting of various urban planning components and implementation indicators-reflect the abilities of a master plan to respond to climate change mitigation in India. Results highlight the use of master plans as an effective tool in mitigating climate change, thereby promoting low-carbon regions through urban planning.

Within this discussion, grasslands have surfaced as being particularly important, due to their geographic range, their capacity to store substantial quantities of carbon relative to cultivated croplands and their potential role in mitigating droughts and floods. However, leveraging grasslands for climate change mitigation and adaptation will require a better understanding of how farmers and ranchers who rely on them for their livelihoods can improve management and related outcomes. To investigate opportunities for such improvements, we conducted a meta-analysis of field experiments that investigated how soil water infiltration rates are affected by a range of management options: adding complexity to grazing patterns, reducing stocking rates or extended rest from grazing. Further, to explore the relationships between observed changes in soil water infiltration and soil carbon, we identified papers that reported data on both metrics. We found that in 81.9% of all cases, responses of infiltration rates to identified management treatments (response ratios) were above zero, with infiltration rates increasing by 59.3 ± 7.3%. Mean response ratios from unique management categories were not significantly different, although the effect of extended rest (67.9 ± 8.5%, n = 140 from 31 experiments) was slightly higher than from reducing stocking rates (42.0 ± 10.8%; n = 63 from 17 experiments) or adding complexity (34.0 ± 14.1%, n = 17 from 11 experiments). We did not find a significant effect of several other variables, including treatment duration, mean annual precipitation or soil texture; however, analysis of aridity indices suggested that grazing management may have a slightly larger effect in more humid environments. Within our database, we found that 42% of complexity studies, 41% of stocking rate studies and 29% of extended rest studies also reported at least some measure of soil carbon. Within the subset of cases where both infiltration rates and carbon were reported, response ratios were largely positive for both variables (at least 64% of cases had positive mean response ratios in all management categories). Overall, our findings reveal that a variety of management strategies have the potential to improve soil water infiltration rates, with possible benefits for soil carbon as well. However, we identified a shortage of well-replicated and detailed experiments in all grazing management categories, and call for additional research of both soil water and soil carbon properties for these critical agroecosystems.

The projected increase in livestock demand is likely to undermine efforts to keep global average warming below a 2°C target. A carbon tax is often proposed as the preferred demand-side mechanism for reduced meat consumption. Previous studies, however, suggest that while this could prove successful in reducing net global emissions, it may worsen nutritional standards in lowest-income nations. An alternative market mechanism which may simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and improve health at all income levels is a reduction in the price of meat substitute products (meat-free proteins with particular nutritional and aesthetic similarities to meat). Using a combined ecological and health modeling approach, we project the associated GHG savings and health benefits associated with a stepwise reduction in the price of meat substitute products. Utilizing food demand elasticities, we quantify the substitution of meat commodities across a range of social acceptability scenarios. Our results show that meat substitute products—integrated within a “flexitarian” approach (primarily vegetarian but occasionally eating meat and fish)—have a large potential for reducing GHG emissions (up to 583 MtCO2e per year) and improving nutritional outcomes (up to 52,700 premature deaths avoided per year). However, this capacity is strongly dependent on a combination of price reductions and improved social acceptability of this product group; therefore both will be essential. © Copyright © 2018 Ritchie, Reay and Higgins.","dietary change; Flexitarian; greenhouse gas emissions; health; meat substitutes; sustainable protein",,"Ritchie, H.; School of GeoSciences, United Kingdom; email: hannah.ritchie@ed.ac.uk",,"Frontiers Media S.A.",2571581X,,,,"English","Front.

To limit warming to 2 °C, cost-effective mitigation pathways rely on extensive deployments of CO2 removal (CDR) technologies, including multi-gigatonne yearly CDR from the atmosphere through bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation. While these assumed CDR deployments keep ambitious temperature targets in reach, the associated rates of land-use transformation have not been evaluated. Here, we view implied integrated-assessment-model land-use conversion rates within a historical context. In scenarios with a likely chance of limiting warming to 2 °C in 2100, the rate of energy cropland expansion supporting BECCS proceeds at a median rate of 8.8 Mha yr -1 and 8.4% yr -1 . This rate exceeds - by more than threefold - the observed expansion of soybean, the most rapidly expanding commodity crop. In some cases, mitigation scenarios include abrupt reversal of deforestation, paired with massive afforestation/reforestation. Historical land-use transformation rates do not represent an upper bound for future transformation rates. However, their stark contrast with modelled BECCS deployment rates implies challenges to explore in harnessing - or presuming the ready availability of - large-scale biomass-based CDR in the decades ahead. Reducing BECCS deployment to remain within these historical expansion rates would mean either the 2 °C target is missed or additional mitigation would need to occur elsewhere. © 2018 The Author(s).",,"Biomass; Carbon capture; Climate models; Clock and data recovery circuits (CDR circuits); Cost effectiveness; Deforestation; Expansion; Land use; Reforestation; Climate change mitigation; Conversion rates; Cost effective; Deployment rates; Expansion rate; Global temperatures; Integrated assessment models; Transformation rates; Climate change","Turner, P.A.; Department of Global Ecology, United States; email: pturner@carnegiescience.edu",,"Nature Publishing Group",23989629,,,,"English","Nature Sustain.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051790792

Nevertheless, co-benefits and related cost reductions are often not taken into account in decision processes, likely because they are not easy to capture. In an interdisciplinary multi-model approach we address this gap, investigating the co-benefits resulting from increased physical activity and improved air quality due to climate mitigation policies for three urban areas. Additionally we take a (macro-)economic perspective, since that is the ultimate interest of policy-makers. Methodologically, we link a transport modelling tool, a transport emission model, an emission dispersion model, a health model and a macroeconomic Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model to analyze three climate change mitigation scenarios. We show that higher levels of physical exercise and reduced exposure to pollutants due to mitigation measures substantially decrease morbidity and mortality. Expenditures are mainly born by the public sector but are mostly offset by the emerging co-benefits. Our macroeconomic results indicate a strong positive welfare effect, yet with slightly negative GDP and employment effects. We conclude that considering economic co-benefits of climate change mitigation policies in urban mobility can be put forward as a forceful argument for policy makers to take action. © 2018 by the authors.

This paper examines how people discuss strategies to mitigate climate change and the relative responsibilities of individuals, the UK government, and corporations. Twenty people were interviewed about what they thought should be done to reduce the degree of climate change. Three main themes in their responses are identified: (1) representations of climate change; (2) responsibility for action; and (3) opposing environmental and economic interests. Overall, there was support for a variety of climate change mitigation strategies. There was some emphasis on individual behavior change combined with suggestions about greater information provision and the importance of personal choice. Although some participants criticized economic and profit-oriented structures, there was a strong sense among participants that change in this regard was unlikely. An expansion of examples of alternative strategies to address climate change could contribute towards transcending individualized approaches and accentuate perceptions of possibilities for significant social change. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Individualization; Mitigation strategies; Public perception; Responsibility","climate change; economic structure; government; individual variation; individualism; mitigation; perception; public attitude; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; United Kingdom","Becker, S.; School of Psychology, United Kingdom; email: BeckerS@cardiff.ac.uk",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046076568

Specifically, we predicted that attributing responsibility for either causing or mitigating climate change to government entities would bolster perceived collective control for addressing the problem. Results of structural equation modeling suggest that both types of attributions mediate the relationship between perceived threat and control over climate change, with the full model accounting for 57% of the variance in perceived collective control. Moreover, for the overall sample, attributions of responsibility for mitigating climate change emerged as a stronger mediator of perceived control than did causal attributions and as the only significant mediator among Republicans.

In this paper, we study how land use adaptation to climate change impacts land use competition in the agriculture, forest and other land use (AFOLU) sector and how a mitigation policy in agriculture might affect this competition. We use for this purpose two sector-specific bio-economic models of agriculture and forest combined with an econometric land use shares model to simulate the impacts of two climate change scenarios (A2 and B1, 2100 horizon), and a greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture policy consisting of a tax of between 0 and 200 €/tCO2 equivalent. Our results show that both climate change scenarios lead to an increase in the area devoted to agriculture at the expense of forest which could have a negative impact on reducing greenhouse gas emissions responsible for climate change. The mitigation policy would curtail agricultural expansion, and thus could counteract the effects of land use adaptation to climate change. In other words, accounting for land use competition results in a reduction of the abatement costs of the mitigation policy in the agricultural sector. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Greenhouse gas tax; Land rent; Mitigation; Spatial land use share model","adaptive management; agricultural policy; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; econometrics; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; land use change; mitigation; pollution tax; France","Lungarska, A.; Économie Publique, France; email: Anna.Lungarska@inra.fr",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

The objective of this study was to evaluate effectiveness of a number of mitigation strategies for dairy systems, taking into account compensation for changes in the amount of beef produced. Four commonly used mitigation strategies for dairy systems were evaluated using an LCA modelling approach: increasing the milk production per cow, extending the productive life span of cows, increasing the calving interval, and changing breed from Holstein Friesian to Jersey. The Dutch dairy system was taken as a case study. For each scenario, analyses were done in two steps. First, effects of the mitigation strategy on production of milk and carcass weight from the dairy system were calculated. Second, GHG emission intensities were calculated for three different functional units (FU): one kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), one kg of carcass weight (CW), and a fixed amount of milk and beef (i.e. 1 kg FPCM and 40 g CW). In the third FU, in case the amount of CW produced by the dairy system was lower than 40 g per kg FPCM, the remainder was compensated by CW produced in pure beef systems, assuming a GHG emission intensity of 30 kg CO2-eq. per kg CW for pure beef. Results showed a reduction in CW per kg FPCM from the dairy system in all four mitigation strategies. Considering GHG emissions per kg of FPCM only, the strategies reduced emissions by 0.2 to 18.1%. When considering emissions per kg of CW only, emissions were reduced by 12.5 to 48.9%. However, when we used a FU of 1 kg FPCM and 40 g CW, changes in emissions ranged from −0.2 to 3.8%. This was caused by the compensation of the lower CW production from dairy systems by CW from pure beef systems. Differences in emissions per kg FPCM and 40 g CW were smaller when the assumed emission intensity of pure beef was lower. We concluded that the mitigation strategies for dairy systems evaluated in this study were less effective for reduction of GHG emissions from production of milk and beef, when accounting for changes in the amount of beef produced. This study showed that the challenge of reducing GHG emissions of milk and beef production is interrelated. Hence, analyses of GHG emissions related to changes in production of milk and beef requires an integrated approach, beyond the system boundaries of the dairy farm. © 2018 The Authors","Beef; Dairy; Greenhouse gas; Milk; Mitigation","agricultural emission; cattle; climate change; compensation system; dairy farming; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; meat; milk production; mitigation; weight","Vellinga, T.V.P.O.

In particular, bivalves’ ability to extract nutrients from the environment by intensely filtering water and producing a shell must be considered in the environmental assessment. Methods: LCA of blue mussel bouchot culture (grown out on wood pilings) in Mont Saint-Michel Bay (France) was performed to identify its impact hotspots. The chemical composition of mussel flesh and shell was analyzed to accurately identify potential positive effects on eutrophication and climate change. The fate of mussel shells after consumption was also considered. Results and discussion: Its potential as a carbon-sink is influenced by assumptions made about the carbon sequestration in wooden bouchots and in the mussel shell. The fate of the shells which depends on management of discarded mussels and household waste plays also an important role. Its carbon-sink potential barely compensates the climate change impact induced by the use of fuel used for on-site transportation. The export of N and P in mussel flesh slightly decreases potential eutrophication. Environmental impacts of blue mussel culture are determined by the location of production and mussel yields, which are influenced by marine currents and the distance to on-shore technical base. Conclusions: Bouchot mussel culture has low environmental impacts compared to livestock systems, but the overall environmental performances depend on farming practices and the amount of fuel used. Changes to the surrounding ecosystem induced by high mussel density must be considered in future LCA studies. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Carbon sink; Climate change; Eutrophication; LCA; Mussel","nitrogen; phosphorus; acidification; animal shell; animal tissue; Article; bay; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; chemical composition; climate change; environmental impact assessment; eutrophication; France; life cycle assessment; livestock; Mytilus edulis; nonhuman; priority journal","Aubin, J.; INRA, 65 rue de Saint Brieuc, CS 84215, France; email: joel.aubin@inra.fr",,"Springer Verlag",09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.

In the wake of the Paris Agreement, some firms are seeking a means of aligning their targets with sectoral, national and international mitigation commitments. There are numerous ways by which such an alignment can be achieved, each requiring different assumptions. Using data from the UK construction industry, this paper reviews current company commitments and progress in carbon mitigation; analyses the unique challenges in aligning construction targets, and presents a series of possible sectoral decarbonisation trajectories. The results highlight the disparity between current company targets and the range of possible trajectories. It is clear that a cross-industry dialogue is urgently required to establish an appropriate response that delivers both a widely-accepted target trajectory and a plan for its delivery. This paper is intended to stimulate and support this necessary debate by illustrating the impact of different methodological assumptions and highlighting the critical features of an appropriate response. © 2018 The Authors","Buildings; Climate change mitigation; Construction; Embodied carbon; Paris Agreement; Science Based Targets; Whole life carbon","Buildings; Construction; Construction industry; Trajectories; Carbon mitigation; Carbon reduction; Climate change mitigation; Construction firms; Critical features; Embodied carbons; Target trajectory; UK construction industry; Climate change","Giesekam, J.; Sustainability Research Institute, United Kingdom; email: j.giesekam@leeds.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041479719

But, detecting the optimal retrofit strategies for groups of buildings is nowadays a highly complex problem. Their energy consumptions are influenced by building-related factors (climate, building envelope, building services and systems) and by user-related ones (building operation and maintenance, occupant behavior, and indoor environmental quality). Detecting the contributions of each factor and grouping buildings with similarities –in order to establish similar retrofit strategies – are the main issues that can be faced by statistical multivariate methods. In this paper, we present a new and broader view to propose retrofit strategies adapted to a climate change scenario and analyzed from the economic and energy-poverty points of view, by using multivariate and clustering techniques that include building-related and user-related metrics influencing the energy consumption of groups of buildings. A group of 10 single-family houses in Argentina were selected as a case-study. The contributions of eleven building-related driving metrics and four user-related ones to the energy consumption were analyzed. Then, the more representative house of the cluster was selected for a retrofit analysis for current weather conditions and for future weather under a climate change scenario. The analysis also included an economic assessment in relation to the energy poverty. The higher CV values found in the user-related metrics highlight the influence of occupants in the energy consumption that can result in huge gaps between real and predicted energy performance of buildings. This holistic study contributes to reveal the internal structure of energy consumption and to generate useful knowledge about energy retrofit of the built environment in cities, particularly for those householders which are more susceptible to suffer the adverse effects of energy poverty and climate change. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Clustering; Energy poverty; Energy retrofit; Principal components analysis","Buildings; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Retrofitting; Adaptation to climate changes; Clustering; Energy performance of buildings; Energy poverties; Energy retrofit; Improvement of energy performance; Indoor environmental quality; Principal components analysis; Climate change","Flores Larsen, S.; Instituto de Investigaciones en Energía No Convencional (INENCO), Avenida Bolivia 5150, Argentina; email: cfilippin@cepenet.com.ar",,"Elsevier Ltd",03787788,,ENEBD,,"English","Energy Build.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039933634

As the main producer of the inland river basin ecosystem in arid region of Northwest China, the desert riparian forest maintains the regional environment and also holds a great significance in regulating the regional/global carbon cycle. In this study, we estimated the total biomass, carbon storage, as well as monetary ecosystem service values of desert riparian Populus euphratica Oliv. in the lower reaches of the Tarim River based on terrestrial forest inventory data within an area of 100 ha (100 plots with sizes of 100 m × 100 m) and digitized tree data within 1000 ha (with 10 m × 10 m grid) using a statistical model of biomass estimation against tree height (TH) and diameter at breast height (DBH) data. Our results show that total estimated biomass and carbon storage of P. euphratica within the investigated area ranged from 3.00 to 4317.00 kg/ha and from 1.82 to 2158.73 kg/ha, respectively. There was a significant negative relationship (p &lt; 0.001) between biomass productivity of these forests and distance to the river and groundwater level. Large proportions of biomass (64% of total biomass) are estimated within 200 m distance to the river where groundwater is relatively favorable for vegetation growth and biomass production. However, our data demonstrated that total biomass showed a sharp decreasing trend with increasing distance to the river; above 800 m distance, less biomass and carbon storage were estimated. The total monetary value of the ecosystem service ""carbon storage"" provided by P. euphratica was estimated to be $6.8 × 104 USD within the investigated area, while the average monetary value was approximately $70 USD per ha, suggesting that the riparian forest ecosystem in the Tarim River Basin should be considered a relevant regional carbon sink. The findings of this study help to establish a better understanding of the spatial distribution pattern of P. euphratica forest under water scarcity and can also provide an alternative approach to local decision-makers for efficient and precise assessment of forest carbon resources for emission reduction programs. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate change; Groundwater level; Riparian forest; River discharge; Watershedmanagement","Biomass; Climate change; Decision making; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Emission control; Groundwater; Rivers; Watersheds; Biomass and carbon storages; Carbon sequestration potential; Emission reduction programs; Lower reaches of the tarim rivers; Riparian forests; River discharge; Spatial distribution patterns; Watershedmanagement; Forestry; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; forest inventory; groundwater; riparian forest; river discharge; water level; watershed; Biomass; China; Decision Making; Ecosystems; Forestry; Rivers; China; Tarim River; Xinjiang Uygur; Populus euphratica","Halik, Ü.; Key Laboratory of Oasis Ecology, Sheng Li Road 666, China; email: halik@xju.edu.cn",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045311625

Agriculture is the mainstay of livelihood and food security to millions of people living in tropical countries; climate change is posing a serious threat on food production, nutritional security, and livelihoods of poor farming communities of developing countries. This has prompted a renewed interest in mitigation and adaptation strategies to minimize negative impacts of climate change on agroecosystems through introducing promising tree-based alternate land-use systems. Agroforestry systems (AFS) indeed offer viable opportunity to mitigating the atmospheric accumulation of CO2 and other greenhouse gases and potential for transforming into resilient farming systems and help the farmers in adapting to climate change in tropics. The potential of AFS to accumulate carbon (C) was estimated to be 12-228 Mg ha-1, with an average of 95 Mg ha-1. Agroforestry practices also offer climate change adaptation by means of buffering agricultural crops against water deficiencies through ameliorating microclimate, maintaining long-term soil health, and minimizing the incidence of insect and pests under climate change scenarios. The degree of mitigation and adaptation varies according to the structural and functional complexities of systems. In addition, agroforestry systems will provide many tangible benefits to farming communities in the form of food, fuel wood, fodder, timber, medicine, fiber, etc. and be able to address the diverse issues of livelihoods, unemployment, and poverty. Agroforestry systems in developing countries shall ensure the farmers in gaining additional economic benefits of C sequestration by C trading with developed countries under CDM projects. It will help the farmers to improve their farm economy besides securing environmental benefits to global communities.

Mitigation is considered as the most important tasks in dealing with climate change in scientific research, financial support and technical practices as global warming intensifies; while currently the warming trend still cannot be reversed, and adaptation task seemed to gain urgency although it is late-starting. The synergies and tradeoffs of these two strategies revealed increasingly importance on reducing adverse climate effects. Research on synergistic relationships has developed from definition and feasible analysis, to the development of quantitative tools and exploration in practice and application, though the latter aspect is still in its initial stage. Outcomes/other: Our review shows that the traits of mitigation and adaptation, the differences and similarities between them, then illustrate the significance and mechanism of their synergies and tradeoffs. And it is explained that methods and applications of single and integrated models, and cost-effectiveness analysis. Discussion/ Conclusion: We hold the opinion that the future research and applications should be enhanced in terms of four aspects: reinforcement of interrelations and common mechanisms between mitigation and adaptation actions study; building and improving the monitoring and evaluating systems; promoting departmental and regional scale investigations and applications; and establishing policy and security systems. © 2018, © 2018 The Author(s).

The successful implementation of forest management activities to achieve climate change mitigation in British Columbia will be strongly influenced by public support or opposition. While we now have increasingly clear ideas of the management opportunities associated with forest mitigation and some insight into public support for climate change mitigation in the context of sustainable forest management, very little is known with respect to the levels and basis of public support for potential forest management strategies to mitigate climate change. This paper, by describing the results of a web-based survey, documents levels of public support for the implementation of eight forest carbon mitigation strategies in British Columbia’s forest sector, and examines and quantifies the influence of the factors that shape this support. Overall, respondents ascribed a high level of importance to forest carbon mitigation and supported all of the eight proposed strategies, indicating that the British Columbia public is inclined to consider alternative practices in managing forests and wood products to mitigate climate change. That said, we found differences in levels of support for the mitigation strategies. In general, we found greater levels of support for a rehabilitation strategy (e.g. reforestation of unproductive forest land), and to a lesser extent for conservation strategies (e.g. old growth conservation, reduced harvest) over enhanced forest management strategies (e.g. improved harvesting and silvicultural techniques). We also highlighted multiple variables within the British Columbia population that appear to play a role in predicting levels of support for conservation and/or enhanced forest management strategies, including environmental values, risk perception, trust in groups of actors, prioritized objectives of forest management and socio-demographic factors. © 2018 Peterson St-Laurent et al.

Controlling non-point source (NPS) nutrient pollution from cropland, especially dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP), is the key to restore water quality in Lake Erie. To address NPS pollution, previous studies have analyzed the effectiveness of alternative spatially optimal land use and management strategies (represented as agricultural conservation practices (CPs)). However, few studies considered both strategies and have analyzed and compared their sensitivity to expected changes in temperature and precipitation due to climate change and increased greenhouse gas concentrations. In this study, we evaluated impacts of climatic change on the economic efficiency of these strategies for DRP abatement, using an integrated modeling approach that includes a watershed model, an economic valuation component, and a spatial optimization model. A series of climate projections representing relatively high greenhouse gas emission scenarios was developed for the western Lake Erie basin to drive the watershed model. We found that performance of solutions optimized for current climate was degraded significantly under projected future climate conditions. In terms of robustness of individual strategies, CPs alone were more robust to climate change than land use change alone or together with CPs, but relying on CPs alone fails to achieve a high (> 71%) DRP reduction target. A combination of CPs and land use changes was required to achieve policy goals for DRP reductions (targeted at ~ 78%). Our results point to the need for future spatial optimization studies and planning to consider adaptive capacity of conservation actions under a changing climate. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",,"Agriculture; Climate models; Conservation; Eutrophication; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Lake pollution; Lakes; Land use; Nutrients; Optimization; Pollution; Quality control; Site selection; Water pollution; Water quality; Watersheds; Agricultural conservation; Conservation actions; Dissolved reactive phosphorus; Economic efficiency; Integrated modeling approaches; Land use and managements; Spatial optimization; Spatial optimization model; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate prediction; conservation management; conservation status; greenhouse gas; land use change; nonpoint source pollution; phosphorus; pollution control; precipitation (climatology); temperature effect; water quality; watershed; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie","Xu, H.; School for Environment and Sustainability, United States; email: xuhui@umich.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Within the commercial sector, the entire supermarket type establishments have one of the highest rates of energy consumption per square metre in all commercial and industrial sectors. This paper presents for the first time the results of emissions related to energy consumption assessment study for supermarkets in Spain. All consumptions are considered, including lighting, cooling system, heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), bakery ovens, hot water, plugs and others. The results indicate that the cooling system has the largest contribution to most environmental impacts. For example, the global warming potential (GWP) over the 20-year lifetime of a supermarket is 6 kt of CO2 eq. Around 50% of the GWP is from the cooling system, 30% from lighting, 10% from bakery ovens and 8% from HVAC. The measures proposed leads to an overall reduction of the impacts. For instance, the GWP reduces by 44% for the cooling system, by 44% for the lighting, by 11% for the HVAC and by 1% for bakery ovens. The results also highlight that these actions have an amortization period of four years and applied to 50% of large Spanish supermarkets would allow to obtain a 14% annually of the need to reduce GHG emissions generated by diffuse sectors of Spain (258,832 ktCO2/year), agreed in “Objective 20-20-20” by the member states of the European Union by the year 2020. © 2018 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Energy saving; Greenhouse gas emissions reduction; Heat recovery; Residual fluid; Supermarkets",,"Ríos Fernández, J.C.; Energy Department, C/Independencia 13, Spain; email: jcarlosriosfernandez@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",23525509,,,,"English","Sustain.

The results show that on average, US college students and adults have similar WTP values. Chinese adults’ WTP is about three-fifths of US adults’ WTP measured in US dollars, while Chinese students’ WTP is only three-fourths of US students’ WTP. Adjusting for the significant difference in per capita income, Chinese adult and student WTP is over two times larger than that of their US counterparts. In addition, political ideology for US respondents is found to have a significant influence on WTP even when controlling for other covariates, such as environmental concern and climate change belief. © 2017, Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies and Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Contingent valuation; Global warming; Willingness-to-pay",,"Winden, M.; Economics Department, 800 W.

We considered six different crops (barley, wheat, sugar beet, fava bean, onion, and lucerne) and two different countries (Spain and Germany), and used three different indicators of climate change: global warming potential (GWP), global temperature change potential (GTP), and climate tipping potential (CTP). We found that although climate change benefits (GWP) from just sequestration and temporary storage of carbon are sufficient to outweigh impacts stemming from hydrochar production and transportation to the field, even greater benefits stem from replacing climate-inefficient biowaste management treatment options, like composting in Spain. By contrast, hydrochar addition to soil is not a good approach to improving agriculture in countries where incineration with energy recovery is the dominant treatment option for biowaste, like in Germany. Relatively small, but statistically significant differences in impact scores (ISs) were found between crops. Although these conclusions remained the same in our study, potential benefits from replacing composting were smaller in the GTP approach, which due to its long-term perspective gives less weight to short-lived greenhouse gases (GHGs) like methane. Using CTP as indicator, we also found that there is a risk of contributing to crossing of a short-term climatic target, the tipping point corresponding to an atmospheric GHG concentration of 450 ppm CO2 equivalents, unless hydrochar stability in the soil is optimized. Our results highlight the need for considering complementary perspectives that different climate change indicators offer, and overall provide a foundation for assessing climate change mitigation potential of hydrochars used in agriculture. © 2017 The Authors.

Nevertheless, we observe an increasing number of unilateral efforts at different administrative levels and in different parts of the world. Previous academic literature described various individual mechanisms where emissions abroad may increase or decrease as a reaction to unilateral emission reductions. In this paper, we collect a comprehensive set of both positive and negative reactions and analyze them in stylized models. This allows us to identify the most important characteristics that determine the potential of a leader to boost mitigation efforts abroad. We find that this potential depends on (i) a strong ability to generate knowledge through leadership, (ii) a high degree of credibility in the international community, and (iii) a similar economic structure to the most important emitters. While most effects are difficult to quantify, this comprehensive assessment suggests that leakage effects resulting from unilateral mitigation may well be outweighed by positive reactions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Game theory; Leadership; Unilateral climate policy","academic research; climate change; environmental planning; environmental policy; leadership; mitigation","Schwerhoff, G.; Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change (MCC), Torgauer Strasse 12-15, Germany; email: schwerhoff@mcc-berlin.net",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",09500804,,,,"English","J.

The main effects of climate change according to respondents are droughts and floods, with consequences for health and water, energy and food availability. Moreover, the respondents consider the design and application of adequate measurements that allow adaptation and mitigation to climate change important. The findings of this study are significant for awareness at all levels of urban society of the activities and programs that allow for sustainable development in consideration of climate change. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Bogotá, Survey; Climate change; Urban public ideas and knowledge","Surveys; Adaptation to climate changes; Colombia; Design and application; Emerging economies; Food availability; Main effect; Urban population; Urban public ideas and knowledge; Climate change","Pardo Martínez, C.I.; School of Administration, Colombia; email: cipmusa@yahoo.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Understanding the causes, mechanisms and time scales of glacier change is therefore paramount to identifying successful strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Here, we use temperature and precipitation fields from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 output to force a glacier evolution model, quantifying mass responses to future climatic change. We find that contemporary glacier mass is in disequilibrium with the current climate, and 36 ± 8% mass loss is already committed in response to past greenhouse gas emissions. Consequently, mitigating future emissions will have only very limited influence on glacier mass change in the twenty-first century. No significant differences between 1.5 and 2 K warming scenarios are detectable in the sea-level contribution of glaciers accumulated within the twenty-first century. In the long-term, however, mitigation will exert strong control, suggesting that ambitious measures are necessary for the long-term preservation of glaciers. © 2018 The Author(s)",,,"Marzeion, B.; Institute of Geography, Germany; email: ben.marzeion@uni-bremen.de",,"Nature Publishing Group",1758678X,,,,"English","Nat.

Traditional public subsidy instruments such as grants and concessional loans, while critical to supporting nascent technologies or high-capital-cost projects, do not provide the price signals required to shift private investments towards low-carbon alternatives at a scale. Programmes that underwrite the value of emission reductions using auctioned price floors provide price certainty over long time horizons, thus improving the cost-effectiveness of limited public funds while also catalysing private investment. Taking lessons from the World Bank’s Pilot Auction Facility, which supports methane and nitrous oxide mitigation projects, and the United Kingdom’s Contracts for Difference programme, which supports renewable energy deployment, we show that auctioned price floors can be applied to a variety of sectors with greater efficiency and scalability than traditional subsidy instruments. We explore how this new class of instrument can enhance the cost-effectiveness of carbon pricing and complementary policies needed to achieve a 1.5°C outcome, including through large-scale adoption by the Green Climate Fund and other international and domestic climate finance vehicles. Key policy insights Traditional public climate finance interventions such as grants and concessional loans have not mobilized private capital at the scale needed to decarbonize the world economy consistent with the 2°C target, much less 1.5°C, and will likely face ongoing constraints in the future. Auctioned price floors–subsidies that offer a guaranteed price for future emission reductions–maximize climate impact per public dollar while incentivizing private investment in low-carbon technologies. This new subsidy instrument, if applied at scale via the Green Climate Fund and other domestic and international climate finance vehicles, can promote private sector competition to bring down technology costs and drive innovation, thereby supporting a longer term transition to regulation and sector- or economy-wide carbon markets. To facilitate the transition from public subsidy to the market-based support of climate mitigation, auctioned price floors should work in tandem with carbon pricing and complementary policies, using the same accounting and monitoring, reporting and verification toolkits. © 2017 The Author(s).

One key obstacle to very ambitious national mitigation is that some policy makers perceive this to be in competition with major goals of fiscal policy, such as public investment or debt reduction. However, climate policy may actually contribute to these other objectives. Importantly, many fiscal implications of substantial carbon prices, which are essential for stringent mitigation targets such as the 1.5°C goal, have long been neglected by economic analyses of climate change mitigation. We systematically review recent contributions on interactions between climate policy and public finance, which include many topics beyond the classic `double dividend’ of environmental tax swaps. We can thus identify new conclusions about climate policy designs that may overcome fiscal objections and research gaps. We find that national climate policy often aligns with other objectives, provided that climate policies and fiscal policies are integrated well. A first class of interactions concerns public revenue-raising: carbon pricing can replace distortionary taxes and alleviate international tax competition; climate policy also changes asset values, which impacts the base of non-climate taxes and boosts productive investment. Second, they concern public spending, which needs to be restructured as a part of climate policy, while carbon pricing revenues may be recycled for public investment. Third, distributional impacts of climate policies include changes to household expenditures, to asset values and to employment; balancing them often requires fiscal policies. Our findings underline that jointly considering climate policy and fiscal policy can help to make substantial mitigation politically feasible. Key policy insights Climate policy, even under a very ambitious 1.5°C target, may substantially contribute to fiscal objectives, interact with fiscal policies, and lower mitigation costs. Mutual effects concern taxation, aggregate investment, public budgets, infrastructure and fiscal instruments with distributional effects. Better integrating climate policies and fiscal policies increases efficiency and supports political feasibility of very ambitious mitigation. This requires a common understanding of policy makers and academics on the most relevant interactions, based on more exchange and empirical research. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon pricing; distributional effects; policy interactions/integration; public spending; stringent mitigation; tax/taxation","climate change; competition (economics); economic analysis; environmental economics; environmental policy; environmental tax; fiscal policy; international agreement; mitigation; policy making; public spending; tax system","Siegmeier, J.; Technical University of Berlin, Straße des 17.

This paper explores perceptions of co-benefits produced by two community-level projects that pursue ecosystem restoration in South Africa. It develops a new analytical framework to assess the enabling and constraining factors in delivering triple wins for adaptation, mitigation and development. The aim is to investigate the potential for integrating community perspectives into policy and project development and implementation. Data collected through mixed-methods (policy analysis, semi-structured interviews, participatory site visits and focus groups) are analysed using thematic analysis. We find that while the projects investigated have potential to deliver triple wins, siloed approaches presently hinder effective implementation. In particular, project focus on job creation hampers the achievement of longer-term mitigation and adaptation benefits. Operational flexibility, long-term goals, multi-sectoral cooperation and enabling frameworks are imperative to the achievement of triple wins. Findings provide valuable lessons that can be applied across sub-Saharan Africa towards achieving triple wins in climate and development policy and practice, especially those developed with job creation and ecological restoration aims. © 2018 by the authors.","Climate compatible development; Project monitoring and evaluation; Sustainable land management","adaptive management; analytical framework; climate change; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; implementation process; land management; mitigation; project assessment; project management; restoration ecology; sustainable development; South Africa","Favretto, N.; School f Earth and Environment, United Kingdom; email: n.favretto@leeds.ac.uk",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043510213

Mexico indicated in its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution and its Climate Change Mid-Century Strategy that the land sector will contribute to meeting GHG emission reduction goals. Since 2012, the Mexican government through its National Forestry Commission, with international financial and technical support, has been developing carbon dynamics models to explore climate change mitigation options in the forest sector. Following a systems approach, here we assess the biophysical mitigation potential of forest ecosystems, harvested wood products and their substitution benefits (i.e. the change in emissions resulting from substitution of wood for more emissions-intensive products and fossil fuels), for policy alternatives considered by the Mexican government, such as a net zero deforestation rate and sustainable forest management. We used available analytical frameworks (Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector and a harvested wood products model), parameterized with local input data in two contrasting Mexican states. Using information from the National Forest Monitoring System (e.g. forest inventories, remote sensing, disturbance data), we demonstrate that activities aimed at reaching a net-zero deforestation rate can yield significant CO2e mitigation benefits by 2030 and 2050 relative to a baseline scenario ('business as usual'), but if combined with increasing forest harvest to produce long-lived products and substitute more energy-intensive materials, emissions reductions could also provide other co-benefits (e.g. jobs, illegal logging reduction). We concluded that the relative impact of mitigation activities is locally dependent, suggesting that mitigation strategies should be designed and implemented at sub-national scales. We were also encouraged about the ability of the modeling framework to effectively use Mexico's data, and showed the need to include multiple sectors and types of collaborators (scientific and policy-maker communities) to design more comprehensive portfolios for climate change mitigation. © 2018 The Author(s).

More than 80% of the countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) refer to the reduction of agricultural emissions, including livestock, in their nationally determined contribution (NDC) to mitigate climate change. The livestock sector in Kenya contributes largely to the gross domestic product and to GHG emissions from the land use sector. The government has recently pledged in its NDC to curb total GHG emissions by 30% by 2030. Quantifying and linking the mitigation potential of farm practices to national targets is required to support realistically the implementation of NDCs. Improvements in feed and manure management represent promising mitigation options for dairy production. This study aimed (i) to assess mitigation and food production benefits of feed and manure management scenarios, including land use changes covering Kenya’s entire dairy production region and (ii) to analyse the contribution of these practices to national targets on milk production and mitigation, and their biophysical feasibility given the availability of arable land. The results indicate that improving forage quality by increasing the use of Napier grass and supplementing dairy concentrates supports Kenya’s NDC target, reduces emission intensities by 26%–31%, partially achieves the national milk productivity target for 2030 by 38%–41%, and shows high feasibility given the availability of arable land. Covering manure heaps may reduce emissions from manure management by 68%. In contrast, including maize silage in cattle diets would not reduce emission intensities due to the risk of ten-fold higher emissions from the conversion of land required to grow additional maize. The shortage of arable land may render the implementation of these improved feed practices largely infeasible. This assessment provides the first quantitative estimates of the potential of feed intensification and manure management to mitigate GHG emissions and to increase milk yields at sectoral-level and at a high spatial resolution for an SSA country. The scientific evidence is tailored to support actual policy and decision-making processes at the national level, such as ‘Nationally Appropriate Mitigation Actions’. Linking feed intensification and manure management strategies with spatially-explicit estimates of mitigation and food production to national targets may help the sector to access climate financing while contributing to food security. © 2018 The Author(s).","Feed intensification; GHG emissions; Land use change; Livestock production; LivSim; Manure management; Mitigation planning Supplementary material for this article is available online","Agriculture; Dairies; Decision making; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Manures; GHG emission; Land-use change; Livestock production; LivSim; Manure management; Mitigation planning; Climate change; arable land; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; food production; Internet; land use change; livestock farming; manure; milk production; mitigation; quantitative analysis; spatial resolution; strategic approach; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Bos; Pennisetum purpureum; Zea mays","Brandt, P.; Laboratory of Geo-Information Science and Remote Sensing, Netherlands; email: patricbrandt@gmx.de",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17489318,,,,"English","Environ.Res.Lett.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048076277

In this study we propose an approach to aid such negotiations based on quantifying the benefits of interregional cooperation and distributing them among the participants in a fair manner. Our approach is underpinned by advanced optimisation techniques that automate the screening of millions of alternatives for differing levels of cooperation, ultimately identifying the most cost-effective solutions for meeting emission targets. We apply this approach to the Clean Power Plan, a related act in the U.S. aiming at curbing carbon emissions from electricity generation, but also being withdrawn. We find that, with only half of the states cooperating, the cost of electricity generation could be reduced by US$41 billion per year, while simultaneously cutting carbon emissions by 68% below 2012 levels. These win-win scenarios are attained by sharing the emission targets and trading electricity among the states, which allows exploiting regional advantages. Fair sharing of dividends may be used as a key driver to spur cooperation since the global action to mitigate climate change becomes beneficial for all participants. Even if global cooperation remains elusive, it is worth trying since the mere cooperation of a few states leads to significant benefits for both the U.S. economy and the climate. These findings call on the U.S. to reconsider its withdrawal but also boost individual states to take initiative even in the absence of federal action. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2018.",,"Cost effectiveness; Electric power generation; Climate change mitigation; Cooperative mechanisms; Cost of electricity; Cost-effective solutions; Electricity generation; Global cooperation; Interregional cooperation; Optimisation techniques; Climate change; action plan; carbon emission; climate change; cost analysis; electricity generation; environmental economics; international agreement; international cooperation; mitigation; national economy; negotiation process; optimization; participatory approach; United States","Guillén-Gosálbez, G.; Centre for Process Systems Engineering, United Kingdom; email: g.guillen05@imperial.ac.uk",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",17545692,,,,"English","Energy Environ.

Genetic improvement of vegetable crops is an appropriate adaptation strategy to cope with climate change adversities. A combination study of genomics and phenomics provides a clear understanding of the environment’s effect on the transformation of a genotype into phenotype. Grafting of a susceptible scion cultivar onto a resistant rootstock is another way of utilising plant biodiversity against climate change. Agronomic practices such as resource conservation technologies, mulching, organic farming, carbon sequestration by cropping systems and agroforestry provide a suite of possible strategies for addressing the impacts of climate change on vegetable production. Protected cultivation and post-harvest technology can be significant practices in facing the challenges of climate change.

Although the maximum achievable hydropower generation (MAHG) will be affected by climate change, it is seldom incorporated in integrated assessment models. In this study, we first used the H08 global hydrological model to project MAHG under two physical climate change scenarios. Then, we used the Asia-Pacific Integrated Model/Computable General Equilibrium integrated assessment model to quantify the economic consequences of the presence or absence of mitigation policy on hydropower generation. This approach enabled us to quantify the physical impacts of climate change and the effect of mitigation policy—together and in isolation—on hydropower generation and the economy, both globally and regionally. Although there was little overall global change, we observed substantial differences among regions in the MAHG average change (from − 71% in Middle East to 14% in Former Soviet Union in RCP8.5). We found that the magnitude of changes in regional gross domestic product (GDP) was small negative (positive) in Brazil (Canada) by 2100, for the no mitigation policy scenario. These consequences were intensified with the implementation of mitigation policies that enhanced the price competitiveness of hydropower against fossil fuel-powered technologies. Overall, our results suggested that there would be no notable globally aggregated impacts on GDP by 2100 because the positive effects in some regions were canceled out by negative effects in other regions. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.",,"Climate models; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Asia-pacific integrated models; Climate change scenarios; Global climate changes; Gross domestic products; Hydro-power generation; Hydrological modeling; Integrated assessment models; Price competitiveness; Climate change; climate change; competitiveness; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; fossil fuel; global change; global climate; Gross Domestic Product; hydroelectric power; hydrological modeling; mitigation; policy analysis; policy implementation; power generation; scenario analysis; Brazil; Middle East; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Rim; USSR","Zhou, Q.; National Institute for Environmental Studies, 16-2 Onogawa, Japan; email: zhou.qian@nies.go.jp",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

At the same time, increasing electricity access can have notable consequences for global climate change. This paper analyses trade-offs and synergies between achieving universal electricity access and climate change mitigation in Sub-Saharan Africa, using the IMAGE-TIMER integrated assessment model. For this purpose, we analysed developments in a number of indicators that describe demand, production, and costs of the future power system under various scenarios with and without climate change mitigation policies. The results show that, achieving universal electricity access requires an annual investment of USD 27–33 billion until 2030 on top of baseline investment. There is a strong synergy in emissions reduction and investment savings, particularly driven by the regions’ efficiency improvements of household appliances (the purchase of efficient appliances and the efficient use of the appliances). On the other hand, climate mitigation policies are projected to increase the cost of electricity per kWh, depending on fossil fuel share in the mix. Therefore, we conclude that, climate policies will need to be combined with complementary policies- e.g. pro-poor tariffs, fuel subsidies, and cross subsidization- to protect the poor from increasing electricity prices. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Electricity access; Sub-Saharan Africa","Climate models; Commerce; Costs; Domestic appliances; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Investments; Purchasing; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Cross-subsidization; Efficiency improvement; Electricity access; Global climate changes; Integrated assessment models; Sub-saharan africa; Climate change; climate change; electricity; emission control; environmental policy; price dynamics; public access; savings; tariff structure; trade-off; Sub-Saharan Africa","Dagnachew, A.G.; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment AgencyNetherlands; email: Anteneh.dagnachew@pbl.nl",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038908041

Research was quick to identify the ‘headline numbers’ of NDCs: if these climate action plans were fully implemented, global mean warming by 2100 would be reduced from approximately 3.6 to 2.7°C above pre-industrial levels (Höhne et al. Climate Pol 17:1–17, 2016; Rogelj et al. Nature 534:631–639, 2016). However, beyond these headline mitigation numbers, NDCs are more difficult to analyse and compare. UN climate negotiations have so far provided limited guidance on NDC formulation, which has resulted in varying scopes and contents of NDCs, often lacking details concerning ambitions. If NDCs are to become the long-term instrument for international cooperation, negotiation, and ratcheting up of ambitions to address climate change, then they need to become more transparent and comparable, both with respect to mitigation goals, and to issues such as adaptation, finance, and the way in which NDCs are aligned with national policies. Our analysis of INDCs and NDCs (Once a party ratifies the Paris Agreement, it is invited to turn its Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) into an NDC. We refer to results from our INDC analysis rather than our NDC analysis in this commentary unless otherwise stated.) shows that they omit important mitigation sectors, do not adequately provide details on costs and financing of implementation, and are poorly designed to meet assessment and review needs. © 2017, The Author(s).",,"Industrial research; International cooperation; Action plan; Global mean warming; National policies; Pre-industrial levels; Climate change; action plan; adaptive management; climate change; finance; global warming; international agreement; international cooperation; mitigation; negotiation process","Pauw, W.P.; Utrecht UniversityNetherlands; email: w.p.pauw@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

This article investigates the impact of a national guideline on climate and energy planning adopted in Norway, a soft regulatory instrument, which sought to encourage stronger local climate mitigation policies. To assess the effectiveness of this policy approach the research reported here investigated the impact of the guideline on the institutionalization of local climate policy activity in a set of Norwegian municipalities. Our findings indicate that for municipalities in the early phases of developing their climate mitigation policy the planning guideline contributed to legitimizing climate policy by linking it to other policy areas. For municipalities that had come further in developing their climate mitigation policy, however, the planning guideline made little difference. The findings indicate that even if soft policy instruments might be needed in a situation with complex regulatory issues, it is difficult to achieve results without the support of harder policy measures. This is particularly the case if local authorities face financial constraints and lack manpower in their work in developing effective climate mitigation policy.

In previous research on India, we developed a theoretical framework to assess the structural characteristics of different sectors and identify which ones were most amenable to mitigation. In this article, we extend that approach to China and review the nine sectors responsible for most of the country's emissions. These include electricity (disaggregating renewables, nuclear, and coal), road transportation, four disaggregated industry sub-sectors (steel, cement, fertilizers, and oil refining), and buildings. We identify two sets of attributes, what we called political/organizational feasibility and techno-economic feasibility, that together shape the possibilities for emissions mitigation. Our central intuition is that fragmentation − on the government or market side or both − makes collective action more difficult. Cement, steel, and oil refining possess favorable characteristics on both political/organizational feasibility and techno-economic feasibility, while fertilizers and renewables pose the most difficult challenges on both dimensions. Buildings and road transport are mixed cases, where techno-economic feasibility is high while political/organizational dynamics are more challenging. Finally, coal and nuclear are mixed cases where political/organizational feasibility is high but techno-economic aspects are more challenging. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; Climate change; Mitigation; Political feasibility; Sectoral",,"Busby, J.; LBJ School of Public Affairs, United States; email: busbyj@utexas.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

However, in many countries and for many companies worldwide a complete transition to rail transport of freight is not feasible due to either a lack of available railway infrastructure or high investment costs. With that in mind, this paper aims to assess the potential of road-rail intermodal operations as a strategy to reduce atmospheric emissions, and thereby help mitigate climate change worldwide. This was achieved by quantifying and comparing emissions of CO2, CO, CH4, NOx, hydrocarbons and particulate matter in a case-study that considered road-only and intermodal road-rail routes from 17 production facilities to their nearest port, according to International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) policies, as well as Euro V and EPA (United State Environmental Protection Agency) emission standards. The results showed that an intermodal road-rail operations would reduce emissions by up to 77.4%, be up to 43.48% more fuel-efficient and up to 80% cheaper than operating solely with road transport, posing as a viable strategy to enable more companies and countries to mitigate climate change. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Emissions; Freight; Greenhouse gas; Intermodal; Rails; Roads",,"Bilotta, P.; Positivo University, 5300 Professor Pedro Viriato Parigot de Souza Street, Campo Comprido, Brazil; email: pb.bilotta@gmail.com",,"Elsevier B.V.",22114645,,,,"English","Environ.

We test the effects of variations in text and imagery on discrete emotions (i.e., hope, fear, and anger) and, indirectly, on support for climate mitigation policies. Political ideology is examined as a moderator. The findings indicate that news images and texts that focus on climate-oriented actions can increase hope and, in the case of texts, decrease fear and anger, and these effects generally hold across the ideological spectrum. In turn, the influence of emotions on policy support depends on ideology: Hope and fear increase support for climate policies for all ideological groups but particularly conservatives, whereas anger polarizes the opinions of liberals and conservatives.

Several adaptation and mitigation strategies to counteract climate change impacts have been proposed for these ecosystems. However, effective implementation of such strategies requires a clear understanding of how climate change will influence the future distribution of forest ecosystems. This study uses maximum entropy modelling (MaxEnt) to predict environmentally suitable areas for cork oak (Quercus suber) woodlands, a socio-economically important forest ecosystem protected by the European Union Habitats Directive. Specifically, we use two climate change scenarios to predict changes in environmental suitability across the entire geographical range of the cork oak and in areas where stands were recently established. Up to 40 % of current environmentally suitable areas for cork oak may be lost by 2070, mainly in northern Africa and southern Iberian Peninsula. Almost 90 % of new cork oak stands are predicted to lose suitability by the end of the century, but future plantations can take advantage of increasing suitability in northern Iberian Peninsula and France. The predicted impacts cross-country borders, showing that a multinational strategy, will be required for cork oak woodland adaptation to climate change. Such a strategy must be regionally adjusted, featuring the protection of refugia sites in southern areas and stimulating sustainable forest management in areas that will keep long-term suitability. Afforestation efforts should also be promoted but must consider environmental suitability and land competition issues. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Afforestation; Climate change impacts; Conservation planning; Dehesa; Environmental niche modelling; Montado","action plan; adaptive management; afforestation; agroforestry; biodiversity; climate change; conservation planning; environmental modeling; environmental policy; European Union; forest ecosystem; forest management; habitat management; implementation process; maximum entropy analysis; mitigation; niche; prioritization; spatial analysis; woodland; France; Iberian Peninsula; North Africa; Quercus suber","Correia, R.A.; Centre for Ecology, Portugal; email: rahc85@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

Focusing on wood use for piles, check dams, paved walkways, guardrails, and noise barriers, we quantified the nationwide potential for climate change mitigation in civil engineering in Japan through 2050. To assess mitigation potential, we examined life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are avoided by storing carbon in wood and forests, substituting wooden materials for non-wooden materials (cement, concrete, steel, and asphalt), and substituting processing residue and waste wood salvaged from defunct civil engineering structures for fossil fuels (heavy oil). Our projections suggest that there will be a maximum potential domestic log volume of 6.80 million m3/year available for civil engineering use in Japan in 2050, and that it would be possible to produce this volume while increasing Japan's forest resources over the long term. A maximum nationwide avoided GHG emissions potential of 9.63 million t-CO2eq/year could be achieved in 2050, which is equivalent to 0.7% of Japan's current GHG emissions. The breakdown of avoided emissions is 73%, 19%, and 8% for carbon storage, material substitution, and energy substitution, respectively, with the greatest contributions coming from carbon storage through the use of log piles. © 2018 by the authors.","Carbon storage; Energy substitution; Life-cycle assessment (LCA); Log pile; Material substitution; Woodchip-paved walkway; Wooden check dam; Wooden guardrail; Wooden noise barrier","biogenic material; carbon sequestration; civil engineering; climate change; emission control; energy efficiency; environmental impact assessment; forest resource; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; wood; Japan","Kayo, C.; Graduate School of Agriculture, 3-5-8 Saiwai-cho, Japan; email: kayoc@cc.tuat.ac.jp",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042412082

There are two ways to mitigate these changes, by maintaining the greenhouse gasses below the carbon budget and by conserving the marine and terrestrial vegetation for carbon sequestration. These two strategies become variable to the carbon sequestration index (CSI) that represents the potential of a region in carbon sequestration, according to its natural capacity. As a study case, we conducted carbon sequestration research in Bintan region (Bintan Island and its surrounding), Riau Archipelago province. This research was aimed to assess the CSI and its possibility for climate change mitigation. We observed carbon sequestration of seagrass meadows and mangrove, greenhouse gas (CO2) emission (correlated to population growth, the increase of vehicles), and CSI. Bintan region has 125,849.9 ha of vegetation area and 14,879.6 ha of terrestrial and marine vegetation area, respectively. Both vegetation areas are able to sequester 0.262 Tg C yr-1 in total and marine vegetation contributes about 77.1%. Total CO2 emission in Bintan region is up to 0.273 Tg C yr-1, produced by transportation, industry and land use sectors. Therefore, CSI of the Bintan region is 0.98, which is above the global average (i.e. 0.58). This value demonstrates that the degree of sequestration is comparable to the total carbon emission. This result suggests that Bintan's vegetation has high potential for reducing greenhouse gas effects. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Bins; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Landforms; Population statistics; Vegetation; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Atmospheric systems; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Global carbon cycle; Marine vegetation; Population growth; Terrestrial vegetation; Climate change",,"Yuniati M.D.Mukti M.M.Setiadi B.","Institute of Physics Publishing",17551307,,,,"English","IOP Conf.

Urbanization is a global trend and is associated with increases in income, and higher urban incomes are correlated with higher consumption of energy and GHG emissions. This has resulted in increasing levels of greenhouse gases which absorb heat mainly infrared radiation, emitted from the Earth's surface. Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of these gases cause Earth to warm by trapping more of this heat. The CO 2 level in 2012 was about 40% higher than it was in the nineteenth century. During Conference of the Parties (COP21), at Paris Climate Conference, (2015) a legally binding and universal agreement on climate change was achieved, with the aim of keeping global warming below 2 °C. Substantial cuts in anthropogenic GHG emissions by mid-century through large-scale changes in energy systems and altered land use can be achieved. Biofuels, according to the IEA, could displace enough petroleum to avoid the equivalent of 2.1 Gigatons (Gt) of carbon dioxide emission each year if produced sustainably - about as much as net carbon dioxide absorbed by the oceans. Currently, second-generation cellulosic biofuels and third-generation algal biodiesels are prominent biological approaches to sequester and convert CO 2 . The race is on to optimize the technology that can produce biofuels from lignocellulose sources, and it is expected that biotechnological advancement is expected to make this happen in the near future for the benefit of mankind.

GEF and the co-fundraisers—multilateral aid agencies, such as UNDP, the World Bank, FAO, the Asian Development Bank, and UNEP, bilateral aid agencies, such as Germany, the United States and the European Union, the private sector and nongovernmental organizations—all work to enhance REDD+ co-benefits. Because private contributions to the GEF are limited, it is important to design a scheme to mobilize more private financing for REDD+. © 2017 Universitas Brawijaya.","Adaptation; Biodiversity; Finance; Mitigation; REDD+",,"Morita, K.; Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, 1 Matsunosato, Japan; email: kanakomorita@ffpri.affrc.go.jp",,"Agriculture Faculty Brawijaya University",01260537,,,,"English","Agrivita",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038238413

Default values for direct CO2 emissions of artificially drained organic soils were increased by a factor of 1.6 for cropland sites and by factors ranging from 14 to 24 for grassland sites. This highlights the role of drained organic soils as emission hotspots and makes their rewetting more attractive as climate change mitigation measures. Drainage emissions of humic soils are lower on a per hectare basis and not covered by IPCC default values. However, drainage of great areas can turn them into nationally relevant emission sources. National policy making that recognizes the importance of preserving organic and humic soils’ carbon stock requires data that is not readily available. Taking Ireland as a case study, this article demonstrates how a dataset of policy relevant information can be generated. Total area of histic and humic soils drained for agriculture, resulting greenhouse gas emissions and climate change mitigation potential were assessed. For emissions from histic soils, calculations were based on IPCC emission factors, for humic soils, a modified version of the ECOSSE model was used. Results indicated 370,000 ha of histic and 426,000 ha of humic soils under drained agricultural land use in Ireland (8% and 9% of total farmed area). Calculated annual drainage emissions were 8.7 Tg CO2e from histic and 1.8 Tg CO2e from humic soils (equal to 56% of Ireland's agricultural emissions in 2014, excluding emissions from land use). If half the area of drained histic soils was rewetted, annual saving would amount to 3.2 Tg CO2e. If on half of the deep drained, nutrient rich grasslands drainage spacing was decreased to control the average water table at −25 cm or higher, annual savings would amount to 0.4 Tg CO2e. © 2017 The Authors","Greenhouse gas; Histosol; IWMS; LULUCF; Organic soil; Peatland","carbon; organic carbon; soil organic matter; agricultural land; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; cropland; geographic distribution; grassland; greenhouse gas; Ireland; land use; moisture; pasture; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; soil acidity; steady state; temperature sensitivity; water table","Paul, C.; Leibniz Centre for Agricultural Landscape Research (ZALF)Germany; email: carsten.paul@zalf.de",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

However, its full potential will only be achieved if the challenges to agroforestry implementation are identified and the most efficient and sustainable solutions are made widely known. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to explore these challenges and to determine the most suitable set of solutions for each challenge that combines local effectiveness with European scale relevance. We performed a two-step “solution scanning” exercise. First, the main challenges to sustainable agroforestry in Europe were identified through 42 participatory workshops with 665 local stakeholders. The solutions to each challenge were scanned and classified into either direct solutions (28) to address climate change or indirect solutions (32) that improve the sustainability of agroforestry. In a second step, the direct solutions were prioritized through expert consultation in terms of their potential benefits for mitigation and adaptation. The most commonly reported barriers were a lack of knowledge and reliable financial support to which the most widely suggested indirect solutions were agroforestry training programmes and the development of safe economic routes. The direct solutions considered as holding the greatest mitigation and adaptation potential were the adoption of practices capable to increase soil organic carbon pools and the implementation of multifunctional hedgerows and windbreaks respectively. Our solution scanning approach can inform the implementation of the European climate strategy in general and to the Common Agricultural Policy in particular by pointing to concrete climate beneficial actions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change strategy; Common agricultural policy; Europe; Nature-based solutions","carbon; organic carbon; adaptation; agricultural land; agroforestry; biomass; climate change; ecosystem; environmental sustainability; Europe; human; livestock; priority journal; Review; socioeconomics; sustainable agriculture","Hernández-Morcillo, M.; Department of Geosciences and Natural Resource Management, Denmark; email: m.hernandezmorcillo@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

Yet, the rise of China and other emerging economies means a shift away from a reliance on technology transfer and production capabilities to strengthening indigenous innovation capabilities. Drawing on evidence from the hydropower, solar and wind energy industry in China, the paper introduces the concept of ‘geographies of technology transfer and cooperation’ and challenges the North-South technology transfer and cooperation paradigm for low carbon innovation and climate change mitigation. The empirical evidence shows that for low carbon innovation, the conception that China is lacking behind in innovation capabilities is partly outdated. Instead, there is an increase in indigenous innovation capabilities, resulting in South-South technology transfer and cooperation as well as elements of ‘reverse’ South-North technology cooperation. © 2017 The Author","China; Hydropower; Solar; Technology cooperation; Technology transfer; Wind","Hydroelectric power; Innovation; Solar energy; Technology transfer; Wind; Wind power; China; Climate change mitigation; Hydropower; Innovation capability; Low carbon energies; Production capabilities; Solar; Solar and wind energies; Climate change; alternative energy; carbon; climate change; hydroelectric power; innovation; solar power; technology transfer; wind power; China",,,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034071700

A quasi-experimental set-up is offered by the EU Covenant of Mayors (CoM) initiative, which is the mainstream European movement for local authorities voluntarily committing to meet and exceed the European Union 20% GHG emission reduction target by 2020. The electoral impact of the participation of Italian municipalities to the CoM is estimated, using an instrumental variable (IV) approach. Mayors committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in their municipality appear not to lose electoral support at subsequent elections; this is contrary to what would be implied by a simple (biased) ordinary least squares regression. Moreover, IV point estimates are positive, albeit insignificant at standard levels; this could be due to the possibility of some support of citizens for emission reduction commitments. Finally, strong heterogeneity in socio-economic and demographic characteristics is found, with support of the CoM being more pronounced in wealthier and younger cities. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Covenant of Mayors; Emission reduction; Voting","climate change; demographic method; emission control; European Union; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; local participation; mitigation; socioeconomic status; voting behavior; Italy","Martelli, S.; CORE, Belgium; email: simone.martelli@mef.gov.it",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

The analysis is undertaken using a cost-minimisation model for the entire BS region, the BALTCOST model. In the present research, the model has been extended to include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions effects, enabling us to analyse the trade-offs between cost-effective GHG and nutrient load reductions. We run the model for four different scenarios in order to compare the environmental and economic consequences of contrasting strategies: single environmental objective management versus joint implementation strategy. The results show that implementing land-based measures with a sole focus on water quality (to meet the HELCOM's 2013 Baltic Sea Action Plan nutrient abatement targets) can produce climate change mitigation co-benefits equivalent to 2.3% of the 2005 emission level (from agriculture and waste water combined) for the entirety of the BS region. More interestingly, a joint implementation strategy can deliver further climate change mitigation benefit (i.e. up to 5.4%) at a marginal cost that is comparable to mitigation costs reported by other studies for efficient technologies. All in all the results demonstrate that a joint strategy to improve water quality and to reduce climate change is economically beneficial. Our findings show that the cost and the outcome of the implementation vary between countries. This illustrates the need to develop a joint regional policy for water and climate regulation that fully considers the asymmetry in both the expected effects and cost distribution across the countries in the region. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Co-benefit; Cost-minimisation; Economic-hydrological model; Trade-off; Water management","climate change; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; hydrological modeling; joint implementation; mitigation; nutrient dynamics; policy implementation; trade-off; water management; water quality; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea","Nainggolan, D.; Department of Environmental Science, Frederiksborgvej 399, Denmark; email: dna@envs.au.dk",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

The objective of this study is to examine the climate change mitigation potential of the forest sector by developing and assessing potential mitigation strategies and portfolios with various goals in British Columbia (BC), Canada. From a systems perspective, mitigation potentials of five individual strategies and their combinations were examined with regionally differentiated implementations of changes. We also calculated cost curves for the strategies and explored socio-economic impacts using an input-output model. Our results showed a wide range of mitigation potentials and that both the magnitude and the timing of mitigation varied across strategies. The greatest mitigation potential was achieved by improving the harvest utilization, shifting the commodity mix to longer-lived wood products, and using harvest residues for bioenergy. The highest cumulative mitigation of 421 MtCO2e for BC was estimated when employing the strategy portfolio that maximized domestic mitigation during 2017–2050, and this would contribute 35% of BC’s greenhouse gas emission reduction target by 2050 at less than $100/tCO2e and provide additional socio-economic benefits.

They have the greatest ability to quickly develop more efficient systems and implement climate change mitigation policies. Moreover, cities will become the destination of a population migration as humanity grows globally to a population of 11 billion. In this case study, we show that the applicability of the Ecological Footprint, an overarching outcome measure of resource consumption, for targeting climate change mitigation in cities. We focus on the carbon Footprint subcomponent of the Ecological Footprint, and further translate and disaggregate the carbon Footprint into detailed classification of individual consumption according to purpose (COICOP) and analyze the Footprint of consumption associated with each of these categories for 15 Canadian cities according to census metropolitan area (CMA), from each province. The Ecological Footprint of CMAs was calculated from the consumption land use matrix (CLUM) of Canada, by scaling results according to the annual national survey of household spending from 2010 to 2015. The expenditure in electricity was also scaled with the carbon intensity factor. Our findings indicate that the carbon Footprint remains the largest contributor of the Ecological Footprint of CMAs. The carbon Footprint associated with housing varied significantly with the source of electricity production. CMAs relying on renewable energy sources have a substantially lower carbon Footprint than those relying on fossil fuel energy. The carbon Footprint associated with the operation of personal transportation was the second largest among all consumption categories. Financial services is the largest share of the carbon Footprint from service consumption. Clothing consumption caused most of the goods’ carbon Footprint. A better understanding of urban planning of Canadian CMAs and promoting local consumption will improve carbon mitigation and long-term sustainability. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon footprint; Carbon mitigation; Cities; Ecological Footprint; Electricity; Food; Goods; Household expenditure; Services; Sustainable Consumption; Top-down assessment; Transportation","Climate change; Ecology; Economics; Electricity; Environmental impact; Food products; Fossil fuels; Land use; Population dynamics; Renewable energy resources; Surveys; Transportation; Urban planning; Carbon mitigation; Cities; Ecological footprint; Goods; Household expenditure; Services; Sustainable consumption; Topdown; Carbon footprint","Ouellet-Plamondon, C.M.; École de Technologie Supérieure, 100 Notre-Dame Ouest, Canada; email: claudiane.ouellet-plamondon@etsmtl.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Consumption side changes are likely to be needed to achieve sufficient emission reductions. The United Nations emphasize the importance of developed countries taking the lead in lowering emissions to achieve the sustainable development goals. This paper assess to what extent Norwegian households can lower their carbon footprint consistent with territorial emission reductions towards the 2 °C target of global warming through implementing a set of behavioral actions. We evaluate the efficacy of the set of actions both initially and after considering rebound effects. A multiregional environmentally extended input-output database is linked with the Norwegian consumer expenditure survey to analyze both average and marginal expenditure per unit of increased income. Further, linear programming is applied to examine the changes needed by households to reach different emission reduction targets. We find that households implementing the full set of actions without re-spending can obtain a 58% decrease in their carbon footprint. When accounting for the effect of re-spending, this reduction drops to 24–35%, which is not within the requirements of the 2 °C target. The optimization analysis suggests households can achieve reductions up to 45% by restricting re-spending to specific goods and services. This indicates that curbing the rebound effect is key to achieving real reductions in household carbon footprints. We show that changing consumption patterns can significantly contribute to lowering anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions without compromising the level of economic activity. © 2017 The Authors","2 °C target; Carbon footprint; Input-output analysis; Re-spending; Rebound effect; Sustainable lifestyles","Climate change; Economic analysis; Economics; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Linear programming; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Climate change mitigation; Efficiency improvement; Emission reduction targets; Input output analysis; Optimization analysis; Rebound effect; Sustainable lifestyles; Carbon footprint","Lekve Bjelle, E.; Industrial Ecology Programme, Norway; email: eivind.bjelle@ntnu.no",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

To understand how different modeling approaches derive different results for energy-water interactions, the five teams used harmonized assumptions regarding economic and population growth, the distribution of power plants by cooling technologies, and withdrawals and consumption intensities. The multi-model study provides robust results regarding the different but potentially complementary implications of cooling technology policies and efforts to reduce CO2 emissions. The water implications of CO2 emissions reductions depend critically on the approach to these reductions. Focusing on wind and solar power reduces consumption and withdrawals, a focus on nuclear power increases both, and a focus on hydroelectric power could increase consumptive losses through evaporation.

Uptake coefficients of HO2,λ(HO2), onto sub-micrometre TiO2 particles were measured at room temperature and different relative humidities (RHs) using an atmospheric pressure aerosol flow tube coupled to a sensitive HO2 detector. Values of λ(HO2) increased from 0.021±0.001 to 0.036±0.007 as the RH was increased from 11 to 66 %, and the increase in λ(HO2) correlated with the number of monolayers of water surrounding the TiO2 particles. The impact of the uptake of HO2 onto TiO2 particles on stratospheric concentrations of HO2 and O3 was simulated using the TOMCAT three-dimensional chemical transport model. The model showed that, when injecting the amount of TiO2 required to achieve the same cooling effect as the Mt Pinatubo eruption, heterogeneous reactions between HO2 and TiO2 would have a negligible effect on stratospheric concentrations of HO2 and O3. © 2017 Author.",,"aerosol; atmospheric pressure; atmospheric transport; climate change; concentration (composition); correlation; environmental policy; heterogeneity; particle size; reaction kinetics; stratosphere; three-dimensional modeling","Heard, D.E.; School of Chemistry, United Kingdom; email: d.e.heard@leeds.ac.uk",,"Copernicus GmbH",16807316,,,,"English","Atmos.

Brownfield land redevelopment promises climate change mitigation benefits; however, no studies have attempted to quantify the mitigation potential on a city level. Here we propose a method for this purpose. The method is based on life cycle assessment of GHG emission as compared to greenfield land development, in three categories: (1) primary impact (associated with physical state of brownfield sites and greenfield sites), (2) secondary impact (associated with remediation activities at brownfield sites), and (3) tertiary impact (associated with post-remediation usage of the brownfield sites and avoided usage of greenfield land). A quantitative assessment was conducted for the city of San Francisco in the US, a growing city with ambitious carbon reduction plans. City wide contaminated land remediation activities were found to render a significant secondary impact, resulting in increased GHG emission of 3.54 Mt CO2 eq. However, by averting the development of greenfield land, this negative impact was partially off-set by a primary impact reduction of 1.22 Mt CO2 eq. Moreover, the redevelopment of brownfield land offers large tertiary impact reductions due to higher housing density, less utility and road construction needs, shorter commute distances, and smaller household energy consumption. Overall, the results show that brownfield land redevelopment led to a net GHG reduction of 51.9 Mt CO2 eq. over a 70-year period, or 0.74 Mt CO2 yr−1, the equivalent of 14% of San Francisco's 5.3 Mt CO2 eq. GHG emission in 2010. It was found that reduced household electricity and space heating energy consumption and shorter commute distances were the main contributors, accounting for 41.2% and 34.0% of the tertiary impact reduction, respectively. While it is not expected that all cities can fully capture these climate change mitigation benefits, the present study demonstrates a quantification method and emphasizes the large climate change mitigation potential associated with brownfield land redevelopment. Progression of this premise will require regulators and policy makers to better align cities' climate change mitigation strategies with urban planning and development actions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Brownfield development; Climate change mitigation; Consequential life cycle assessment; Greenhouse gas emission; Remediation","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Land reclamation; Life cycle; Pollution; Remediation; Brownfield development; Climate change mitigation; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Heating energy consumption; Household energy consumption; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Planning and development; Quantitative assessments; Climate change","Hou, D.; School of Environment, China; email: houdeyi@tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Of recent interest is the capacity of mangroves to trap atmospheric carbon into their biomass and help mitigate the detrimental impacts of climate change such as tidal surges, sea level rise, coastal erosion, and saltwater intrusion. Mangroves are indeed a unique and productive ecosystem that thrives in the nexus of land and sea. Notwithstanding the small space they occupy, they remain a vital carbon sink because they can accumulate more organic material than other tropical forest types. To ensure the delivery of this important ecosystem service, coastal communities that dwell in proximity to mangroves have significant roles to play. In the Philippines, local communities are lauded stewards of mangrove rehabilitation and protection. This chapter therefore aims to showcase some success stories of community-based mangrove management vis-à-vis their potential impacts on carbon stock production. It also highlights current issues and challenges for advancing climate change mitigation through community-based mangrove management. The chapter recommends how such an ecosystem service can be further harnessed to create more benefits that will sustain local commitments on mangrove conservation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Blue carbon (BC) ecosystems, which include tidal marshes, mangroves, and seagrass meadows, play a key role in climate change mitigation and adaptation. Despite occupying only 0.2% of the ocean surface, they contribute 50% of carbon burial in marine sediments, equivalent to the sequestration of 1%-2% of current global CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. Conversely, damage to these ecosystems risks the release of that carbon back to the atmosphere. Conserving and restoring BC ecosystems not only maintains CO2 sequestration capacity but also services essential for climate change adaptation along coasts, including prevention of shoreline erosion. However, BC ecosystems rank among the most threatened ecosystems on earth. Urgent action is needed to prevent further degradation, to avoid additional greenhouse emissions, as well as restoring degraded habitats to recover their climate change mitigation potential. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Deep ravines pose the problems of inaccessibility, very steep slope of ravine banks, strong water flow lines, and high permeability of soil making limited land shaping unavoidable. After necessary land shaping in world infamous Chambal ravines covering an area of 304,300 ha in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh states of India, strategy for viable production and mitigation of climate change was framed, and accordingly five different modules of plantation were tried, namely diversified cropping, agri-horticultural, horti-pastoral, silvi-medicinal, and silvopastoral, using land according to its suitability. The greatest carbon was produced under diversified cropping system followed by horti-pastoral, agri-horticultural, silvi-medicinal, and silvopastoral system during the first year, whereas maximum carbon production with agri-horticulture is followed by horti-pastoral, diversified cropping system, silvi-medicinal, and silvopastoral system from second year onward. Similarly, under crops' higher yield and carbon production with 150% of recommended dose of fertilizers were obtained. The highest carbon production among crops and plants was with Moringa oleifera followed by Dalbergia sissoo and pearl millet followed by maize, respectively. The land and water management works must be planned for entire watershed starting from the ridge and including tableland. While technology for shallow and medium ravines has been worked out, afforestation of deep ravines is recommended. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",,,"Singh, A.K.; RVS Krishi Vishwa Vidyalaya, India; email: vcrvsaugwa@mp.gov.in",,"Springer International Publishing",,9789811080432; 9789811080425,,,"English","Ravine Lands: Greening for Livel. and Environ.

Most of the farmers know and understand the climate change information from the television. Farmers mostly feel this climate change through the increase in temperature and the number of dry days. The impact of the climate change affects the livelihood of the farmers, not a few farmers suffered the losses due to the decreased in productivity. To reduce the decrease in income, the farmers increase the use of input, thus affecting the income of the farmers. The results of a comparison of the farmers between 2009 and 2015, there is an increase in productivity and revenue, but this increase is lower than the increased costs incurred by the farmers. This resulted in lower revenues of the farmers in 2015 than in 2009. There are 3 kinds of the strategies which is undertaken by the farmers: economic, ecological and social adaptation. For the economic adaptation, the expectations of the farmers to the capital assets are higher than the actual condition. Ideally, the highest ideal expected by the farmers is physical capital, while the lowest is social capital. Meanwhile, for the ecological adaptation, the community seeks to improve the irrigation channel, replace commodities and utilize the appropriate technology. As for the social adaptation, farmers are expecting the help from the government. The policy implications from this research are: 1) the farmer in Jatiluwih are mostly aware of climate change, some strategies have been implemented by the farmers to maintain their income that affected by the climate change such as to work in the city or become a tour guide in their area. Based on the analysis of the sustainable livelihood, the farmers' expectation of physical capital such as electricity, water, irrigation, and roads are relatively high compared to the other capital. Because of the cost of supply is high, the provision of the physical capital is not easy, the government intervention is needed. Therefore, the farmers are expecting the government to be able to improve the condition of these facilities, especially for the irrigation. Irrigation plays an important role in farming. 2) The social capital of the farmers is high, the farmers have a good relationship with the government, indigenous people, and farmer groups. Therefore, in addition to providing the physical assistance, the government can also conduct the guidance and socialization on reducing the impact of the climate change through farmer or cultural group. © 2018 Authors.","Climate change; Jatiluwih; Mitigation and adaptation; Subak; Sustainability livelihood analysis",,"Sari, D.A.P.; Environmental Engineering, Indonesia; email: deffi.sari@bakrie.ac.id",,"Science Publishing Corporation Inc",2227524X,,,,"English","Int.

One solution finding its place as a key strategy in a number of sustainable development goal areas is biochar. Biochar is a geo-engineered bi-product that is similar in appearance to charcoal which differs from charcoal in that the organic biomass waste from which it is created is heated in an enclosed chamber to low temperatures and deprived of oxygen. This paper investigates the latest studies in crop productivity, commercial viabilities, and the socio-economic options of biochar production at a local and international level in the pursuit of sustainability and climate change mitigation. In terms of sustainability the uptake of biochar as a model for sustainable agriculture is steadily gaining momentum due to its agronomic potential for crop yields, organic soil carbon, carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. The economic viability of biochar production varies markedly around the world. The most promising opportunities for soil carbon sequestration have derived from voluntary carbon markets and government initiatives such as Australia’s Emissions Reduction Fund. The scheme promoted the integration of biochar in land use management practices at a farm scale. If biochar is to have a more profound impact on a global scale, then countries need to adopt a sustainable biochar strategy which is universal along with standardised sustainability protocols. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Biochar; Climate change mitigation; Soil productivity; Sustainable cities",,"Rodrigues, S.; School of Engineering, 124 La Trobe Street, Australia; email: s9776089@student.rmit.edu.au",,"Springer",21997373,,,,"English","World Sustain.

Coastal flooding and erosion put at risk infrastructures and activities that humans have been developing in the littoral during the twentieth century. Perceptions about this space changed and people forgot that coasts are instable territories. Solutions to mitigate the impacts of climate change in coastal zones are now being searched. Looking back, to the past, can help. For centuries, the fishing communities developed strategies to survive in this hostile environment. Their ecological traditional knowledge can provide practical responses to present challenges. The last IPCC report recognizes that local and traditional knowledge, being a major resource in response to climate change, have not been used consistently. The aim of this chapter is to address the case of the Portuguese fishing populations to show how they developed coping practices using the available resources and simple technical means. Fishersâ€™ key-strategies included special architecture forms, seasonal activities and a specific local knowledge that permitted them to recognized climate and coastline changes. Their lessons are compared to mitigation and adaptation measures being proposed nowadays. This allows to establish which ones are more suited to the Portuguese coast specificity and therefore will probably be more effective. These examples are useful for improving communication with decision-makers and increasing public awareness of future changes stressing the need for a more sustainable development. © Springer International Publishing AG 2018.","Coastal management; Fishers; Global changes; Historical approach; Sustainable development",,"de Freitas, J.G.; IELT, Avenida de Berna, 26â€“C, Portugal; email: jgasparfreitas@gmail.com",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071507450

This chapter is an attempt to explore the role and responsibility of mass media to disaster risk reduction and mitigation in coastal area especially in the south-western part of Bangladesh. The chapter also aims to measure the access of information to the rural masses and their preparedness for mitigation to the losses of upcoming hazards. As part of the methodology, a semi-structured interview was conducted in order to obtain quantitative data and 200 respondents were interviewed using purposive sampling. Along with this, some qualitative tools i.e. FGDs (Focus Group Discussions) and KIIs (Key Informants Interviews) were adopted to support the quantitative data. The findings of the study indicate that Radio and Television are the most effective and usable means, disseminating hazards related-news among the coastal people because of its cheapness and easy accessibility. The findings also reveal that mass media influence people to take precautionary activities such as going to cyclone center, saving property/livestock, shifting children and elderly people to safer place etc. The findings also indicate that many of the respondents cannot have access to media-news due to poor communication system, cost effectiveness, uncertainty to get news, shortage of media workers, poor infrastructural development etc. However, for mitigating the loss of natural hazards effectively, the findings keep emphasize on getting cheap access of news, developing communication system, circulating timely authentic disaster-related news, ensuring disseminate news to remote area and increasing awareness among coastal people in Bangladesh. Very few empirical studies on climate change communication as well as mass media to disaster risk reduction and mitigation are found in the existing literatures. So as a part of effective climate change communication system, this work may help government as well as policy makers to make and implement policy to disaster risk reduction and mitigation in the hazards prone coastal area.

This is also the case for know-how on climate change (CC) mitigation in the agricultural sector, which is held responsible for approximately 10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Even though numerous mitigation options at the farm level have already been identified, they still lack broad implementation. Serious games have increasingly gained attention as a medium for knowledge transfer on CC mitigation. This paper analyses if such games are also helpful for the transfer of mitigation and adaption knowledge to the actors of the agricultural sector. The paper starts with a short introduction of characteristics of serious games, and an overview of published games on CC with a focus on agriculture. It then presents a game prototype where the players act as farmers who invest a given budget into their choice of CC mitigation measures. Yet, the prototype focuses on mitigation in industrialized agriculture. It was exemplarily played by different target groups (interested lay people, stakeholders). The paper qualitatively presents lessons learned from this attempt to communicate the complex topic via a game approach.

Although a complex problem demands complex solutions, barriers to interdisciplinary visions and intersectoral coordination persist. Particularly, office-based projects (paper) rarely reach the implementation stage (action), while few contemplate the synergies between mitigation and adaptation. This article analyses climate change plans and programs for the coffee sector considering the coffee rust epidemic, a disease caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix which has generated important losses to coffee production since the 2012/2013 cycle. Structural problems created ideal conditions for this disease which has been associated with climate change, whilst the institutional response has generated new challenges for coffee producing communities who live in biodiversity hotspots like the Chiapas Sierra Madre in southern Mexico. We discuss the synergies between climate change mitigation and adaptation by analyzing the campaign in favor of carbon stocks and biodiversity in shade-grown coffee plantations of the Sierra Madre de Chiapas. Designed in response to the current coffee rust epidemic, this campaign emphasizes deforestation, forest degradation and loss of ecosystem services that is associated with the current crisis of shade-grown co-ffee, with proposals set out to benefit both ecosystems and the coffee communities. We identify three challenges which mark the distance between paper and action, as exemplified in the case of the coffee crisis in the Chiapas Sierra Madre. © 2018, Instituto de Ecologia, A.C.

The hitherto failure to deploy CCS on the required scale has led to the search for options to improve its economic return. CO 2 capture and utilisation (CCU) has been proposed as an opportunity to generate value from waste CO 2 emissions and improve the economic viability of CCS, with the suggestion of using curtailed renewable energy as a core component of this strategy. This study sets out to quantify (a) the amount of curtailed renewable energy that is likely to be available in the coming decades, (b) the amount of fossil CO 2 emissions which can be avoided by using this curtailed energy to convert CO 2 to methanol for use as a transport fuel-power-to-fuel, with the counterfactual of using that curtailed energy to directly remove CO 2 from the atmosphere via direct air capture (DAC) and subsequent underground storage, power-to-DAC. In 2015, the UK curtailed 1277 GWh of renewable power, or 1.5% of total renewable power generated. Our analysis shows that the level of curtailed energy is unlikely to increase beyond 2.5% until renewable power accounts for more than 50% of total installed capacity. This is unlikely to be the case in the UK before 2035. It was found that: (1) power-to-DAC could achieve 0.23-0.67 tCO 2 avoided MWh -1 of curtailed power, and (2) power-to-Fuel could achieve 0.13 tCO 2 avoided MWh -1 . The power-to-fuel concept was estimated to cost $209 tCO 2 avoided -1 in addition to requiring an additional $430-660 tCO 2 avoided -1 to finally close the carbon cycle by air capture. The power-to-DAC concept was found to cost only the $430-660 tCO 2 avoided -1 for air capture. For power-to-fuel to become profitable, hydrogen prices would need to be less than or equal to $1635 tH 2 -1 or methanol prices must increase to $960 t MeOH -1 . Absent this change in H 2 price or methanol value, a subsidy of approximately $283 tCO 2 -1 would be required. A core conclusion of this study is that using (surplus) renewable energy for direct air capture and CO 2 storage is a less costly and more effective option to mitigate climate change than using this energy to produce methanol to substitute gasoline. © 2018 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Fuel storage; Fuels; Methanol; Climate change mitigation; Core components; Economic returns; Economic viability; Installed capacity; Renewable energies; Renewable Power; Underground storage; Climate change; alternative energy; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; cost analysis; economic conditions; environmental economics; methanol; power generation; United Kingdom","MacDowell, N.; Centre for Environmental Policy, Exhibition Road, United Kingdom",,"Royal Society of Chemistry",23984902,,,,"English","Sustain.

Reasons are though complex, include poor economic conditions of majority of population, higher dependence on natural resources and ecosystem service and relatively narrow temperature ranges. Projection of climate change for tropics indicates rise in temperature of 0.4–1 °C, 0.8–3.2 °C and 1.2–6 °C by the 2020, 2050 and 2100 respectively as compared to base line period (1961–1990). Atmospheric CO 2 concentration is likely to reach 550–800 ppm from the present level of 400 ppm by the end of this century. The change associated with climate has never been smooth and likely to be expressed in terms of increased uncertainties and extremities of weather. Number of heat waves witnessed during last 25 years (1990– 2015) in tropics has exceeded as compared to preceding 70 years. Similarly the number of extreme rainfall events as well as drought has also increased in recent past. These changes are likely to impact natural resources, societies and their interdependence. Fruit production being one of the important activities in tropical regions has been largely ignored from the systematic impact analysis of climate change and adaptation studies. Tropical fruits are attuned to the prevailing weather conditions marked by high temperature. There are delineated and defnite ranges of temperature at different phenophases for optimum production of different fruits. Any deviation from the optimum is likely to affect production and quality drastically. The complex interaction of altered temperatures, corresponding phenophases of different fruits, relative suitability of species and cultivars, elevated CO 2 reduced water availability, pollinators, pest and disease and management practices have demonstrated impact and thus will largely determine the tropical fruit production. Tropical fruits where production is presently limited by high temperature are likely to suffer most and probably have to shift to new areas.

Rapid urbanization and its encroachment on agricultural land is a consequence of increase in population. Between 1950 and 2025, the population (106) would increase from 1.4 to 28.6 (20.4 times) of New Delhi, 4.5 to 20.1 (4.5 times) of Kolkata, 2.9 to 25.8 (8.9 times) of Mumbai, 0.6 to 6.6 (11.0 times) of Pune, 1.1 to 8.9 (8.1 times) of Hyderabad, 0.7 to 9.5 (13.6 times) of Bengaluru, and 1.5 to 9.6 (6.4 times) of Chennai. The city of Mumbai generates 11 thousand Mg of waste per day or 4 million Mg per year, which if recycled effectively, can improve urban and peri-urban agriculture. It takes about 40,000 ha of land to provide accommodation and infrastructure to 1 million people. An annual increase of 11.5 million people in India encroaches upon 0.5 million hectare (Mha) of agricultural land. Thus, there is a strong need to protect prime agricultural land against other uses. By 2025, India will have 7 cities of &gt;10 million people, and a city of 10 million consumes 6000 Mg of food per day. Thus, nutrients brought into the city must be returned to the land by recycling waste as compost and for producing energy. Climate change, with increase in frequency of extreme events, is exacerbating vulnerability of agricultural soils to degradation processes. Land area (Mha) in India already affected by degradation includes 93.7 by water erosion, 9.5 by wind erosion, 14.3 by waterlogging, 5.9 by salinity/alkalinity, 16.0 by soil acidity and 7.4 by complex problems. In addition to the impacts of changing and uncertain climate, soil degradation is exacerbated by burning of crop residues, use of cow dung for household cooking rather than as manure, uncontrolled grazing, unbalanced use of fertilizers, and other extractive farming practices. The drought-food syndrome, caused by water misuse and mismanagement, adversely affects agronomic productivity and wellbeing of millions of people despite the fact that India receives 4000 km 3 of annual precipitation.

One practical way to cope with this challenge is to plant trees that could have a great influence on environmental perturbations. Plants act as carbon sink minimize carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) from the atmosphere during photosynthesis and stores excess carbon as biomass in their parts. This study was conducted under semi-arid condition of northern South Africa to evaluate the physiological parameters of three drought tolerant tree species for their comparative tendency to mitigate climate change. An existing moringa (Moringa oleifera) trial, planted at a population of 5000 plants ha -1 was used in this study. The other two naturally growing tree species were mopane (Colophospermum mopane) and marula (Sclerocarya birrea) growing within the moringa trial vicinity were included in the study as a control. Eight trees from each species were tagged for data collection. The photosynthetic rate (A), stomatal conductance (gs), transpiration rate (E) and sub-stomatal CO 2 (Ci) measurements were measured using a fullyexpanded leaf on the abaxial side of each selected leaf using a non-destructive method. Furthermore, three fully expanded leaves were sampled from one tree of each species to determine leaf stomatal density in each replication. The tree species differed significantly in gas exchange, although moringa showed highest activity of all the parameters measured. Stomatal density was also different among the species, being 281.8, 355.2 and 930.6 per unit area for marula, mopane and moringa species, respectively. Moringa maintained good leaf yield even under drought condition, indicated its potential to act as a good sink for CO 2 assimilation. The results strongly showed the superiority of moringa in capturing more carbon among the three species. Moringa can therefore be recommended for climate change mitigation in semi-arid areas of Limpopo province and possibly other areas. © 2018 Friends Science Publishers.","Climate change; Gas exchange; Marula; Mopane; Moringa; Stomatal density",,"Mabapa, P.M.; University of Limpopo, Private Bag X1106, South Africa; email: paulina.mabapa@ul.ac.za",,"Friends Science Publishers",15608530,,,,"English","Int.

Yet, adequate policy instruments can be risky. They interfere with individual freedom of choice and can thus be unpopular. This study investigates the social acceptance of governmental interventions. The study explores four types of climate policy instruments of increasing depth of intervention: 1. information and education, 2. nudging, 3. taxation, 4. bans. Information and nudging are met with the largest degree of approval. Assuming that acceptance will decrease with the depth of intervention, the equally critical perception of taxation and bans is an exception. Apart from the depth of intervention, social acceptance also depends on the field of action. For instance, taxation of airfreight products would be widely accepted.

Montreal’s experience highlights the trade-offs between centralization and policy innovation. Although centralization has produced positive environmental outcomes in the waste management sector through the implementation of a metropolitan area-wide compost program, the experience of Montreal reveals this comes with important trade-offs in local autonomy and engagement.

Rising fossil fuel burning and land use changes to meet human demands continuously emit large quantities of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere thus causing climate change. The research used Talensi District as a case study to determine factors influencing farmers' adaptation response and the actual practices used to avert climate change impact. A total of 225 small-scale farmers were sampled for survey and 100 key informants were used in focus group discussions. Utilizing the logistic regression model, the study indicated that education, transportation, inputs cost and extension services were the factors with high tendency of undermining farmers' ability to adapt to climate change. In addition, Weighted Average Index used to measure weather extremes revealed that drought and temperature had the highest level of occurrence. Climate change adaptation practices assessed in the study showed that change in planting date, improved crops varieties and land rotation were the most preferred practices. The study concluded that farmers resilience could be enhanced if governments and concerned organizations intensify adaptation campaigns, increase access to weather information, and train farmers on adaptable practices including, timely planting and alternative sources of livelihood. In addition, intensifying government support for agriculture including input subsidies, and provision of irrigation facilities were also good interventions to improve climate change resilience. © by Clifford James Fagariba, et al., published by De Gruyter 2019.","adaptation practices; agriculture; climate change; constraints; weather extremes",,"Fagariba, C.J.; School of Resources and Environmental Engineering, China; email: cfagariba@yahoo.com",,"De Gruyter Open Ltd",23919531,,,,"English","Open Agric.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060006203

Locally produced wind turbines have come to embody the promises of the city’s regeneration in the context of the nation's once ambitious efforts to switch to renewable energies. The Energiewende should have resulted in a sustainable future for Bremerhaven, both in economic and ecological terms. However, as Germany’s poorest city, Bremerhaven continues to face severe social problems, from high unemployment to widespread poverty. Under these circumstances, the city pledged to fight the impact of non-renewable energy by becoming a Climate City. It started a process that shall result in the wholesale transformation of the city and its citizens. Bremerhaven's climate change mitigation efforts involve various projects of energy education, which interpellate the whole strata of the local population into reducing the impact of their energy consumption. This chapter unpacks the logics and effects of such attempts at producing energy-efficient citizens by exploring how local activists conceptualise energy impacts in the context of urban poverty and deprivation. Whilst most of my informants take issues of class into consideration, they frame mitigation as an ethical, not a political project, falling short in demands for energy justice and citizens' rights to secure environmental futures. © 2018 selection and editorial matter, Anna Szolucha; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,"Ringel, F.; Durham UniversityUnited Kingdom",,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351213936; 9780815380153,,,"English","Energy, Resource Extraction and Society: Impacts and Contested Futures",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059432581

These distortions of understanding can be traced back to the way in which salvation is articulated and perceived. In the circumstances it becomes a pressing public task to consider the key biblical conceptions of salvation. Of critical significance is how the salvific tradition is understood to be corporate rather than individualistic. That is so right from the beginning of Israel's redemptive history and carries through the biblical material to include God's redemptive work in Christ which is itself extended through to the rest of creation. The current mitigation measures (and their limitations) with regards to climate change are critically evaluated alongside these salvific claims. © koninklijke brill nv, leiden, 2018","Biblical salvation; Climate change; Corporate worldview; Environmental theology; Firstborn of creation; Mitigation",,"Choi, S.; Handong UniversitySouth Korea; email: Sunghochoi80@hotmail.com",,"Brill Academic Publishers",18725171,,,,"English","Int.

As this study shows, there are significant differences in the environmental performance of individual flights, even when operated on the same route or by the same airline. Selecting one flight over another can significantly reduce the carbon dioxide emissions of a single air passenger. Nevertheless, the currently available measures, such as carbon calculators, are not capable of presenting these differences, leaving air passengers with no means of comparing individual flights. Therefore, the use of carbon labels could be highly beneficial because it would give air passengers the opportunity to easily compare the carbon dioxide emissions of individual flights at the time of booking. By making better informed choices, air passengers could not only reduce their own individual carbon dioxide emissions but could also send a strong signal to the airlines. This could motivate airlines to improve their environmental performance, which could be made more visible through carbon labels. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,"Air transportation; Civil aviation; Environmental management; Global warming; Air passengers; Aviation industry; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon labels; Climate change mitigation; Environmental performance; Strong signal; Carbon dioxide","Baumeister, S.; School of Business and Economics, Finland; email: stefan.c.baumeister@jyu.fi",,"Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,9781536141122; 9781536141115,,,"English","Carbon Sequestration and Emissions: Methods, Concerns and Challenges",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058524645

This study established a bottom-up model to project the GHG emission of residential building sector. The model was developed from aggregating the hierarchy structure of household energy use from different components, which were further incorporated to estimate the impact on the total energy usage. Socioeconomic factors were considered as primary drivers to the model, and would further affect the energy demand of household space heating and cooling, lighting, electric equipment, domestic hot water, and cooking. Socioeconomic factors described by statistical models were adopted to predict future population variation and total residential floor area changes. We further quantified the interactions between future climate and the household energy use by building load simulation technique. The results revealed that the GHG emissions will increase to 32.5 Mt C by 2030. The effect of climate change becomes dominant from 2030 to 2060 as the trend of GHG emission remains stable around 32.2 Mt C under RCP8.5 in spite of the decrease in population. Base on the results, two mitigations were proposed: (1) Improving existing criteria of building envelope regulation (2) Enhancing the coefficient of performance of the air-conditioner. © ACRA 2018 - 9th Asian Conference on Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning.

In recent time climate change impacts are being felt, the average global temperature is on the rise every decade since the 1970s. Sea ice and glaciers are disappearing, rising sea levels, species are becoming extinct, droughts that render landscape more susceptible to wildfires, changing seasons and severe weather events are becoming more common. These are problems primarily caused by the emission of greenhouse gases into the environment that results to rise in global temperature. There seems to be a consensus among scientist, researchers and all other stakeholders that climate change is already happening and primarily caused by human activities, a few disagree with this view and attribute climate change as a natural phenomenon. The objective of this paper is to (i) introduce climate change in our world today, (ii) enumerate significant causes of climate change in our environment, as well as the effects (iii), suggest ways the impact of climate change due to GHG emissions and other contributors can be mitigated. © Penerbit UTHM.","Climate change; Global warming; Greenhouse effects",,"Adnan, M.S.; Department of Water Resources and Environmental Engineering, Malaysia; email: shalahudin@uthm.edu.my",,"Penerbit UTHM",2229838X,,,,"English","Int.

Much research has been devoted to national climate change actions, but little is currently known about initiatives and actions at the local level. This study presents results of a survey of U.S. Conference of Mayors Climate Protection Agreement (MCPA) members, representing 1,054 cities and 93.6 million people, conducted to improve the understanding of how mayors view urban forest policies related to climate change. The goals of the study were to examine local government initiatives for climate change and urban forests and how mayors prioritize these investments. The results indicated that a variety of local climate change mitigation and adaptation actions were being pursued by member MCPA cities. This is important as the international climate change regime rarely acknowledges the role of cities tackling climate change, though they are vulnerable settlements and at the same time important emitters. Since MCPA represents the most heavily populated states as well as the majority of the state capitals in the United States, policymakers should seriously consider integrating the roles of these local institutions in the national climate change policy process, and emphasize adaptation and urban forests' role in these efforts. © 2018 Publisher of Mathematical and Computational Forestry & Natural-Resource Sciences.","Cities; Governments; Greening; Municipal; Networks","Forestry; Networks (circuits); Cities; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Climate protection; Governments; Greening; Local institutions; Municipal; Climate change; Adaptation; Cities; Forestry; Forests; Governments; International; Processes; United States",,,"Contemporary Journal Concept Press",19467664,,,,"English","Math.

Fourteen indicators were developed in the sectors of energy, transport, awareness, and physical carbon sinks, and allocated quantitative parameters for ranking. Results were mapped using geographical information systems software. Higher energy results occurred on the two large northern islands both with solar and wind generation facilities, and around some cities with energy efficient street lighting systems. Highest transport scores occurred in the remote west, and around most cities, but mostly not in agricultural areas. Higher awareness levels and overall scores were found around city areas. Higher physical scores resulted from community tree plantings and carbon sequestering vegetation.

Increasing energy efficiency and decarbonizing the economic development, especially with measures aimed at the most energy-intensive sectors (industry, buildings, and mobility) is therefore a way towards the “eco-sustainable” community. The energy efficiency improving has environmental implications as it results in a reduction of the atmosphere polluting emissions. For the GHG (and in particular for the carbon dioxide) it is necessary to study and to analyze the so-called “negative technologies” - technologies that allow a carbon dioxide concentrations reduction. Considering the strategies in order to limit the climate change and to improve the air quality, it is necessary to assess the impacts of both these phenomena and therefore to identify synergies (win - win) and avoiding solutions that improve one of the two phenomena and worsen the other one (win - lose). The aim of this work is to analyze the opportunities of the “negative technologies” application for the climate change mitigation and to formulate the hypothesis of mobility modification using methods for the fuel consumption reduction. The negative technologies were studied from a technological point of view analyzing the potential advantages and disadvantages and stressing the technical challenge. The new approach for reduction of environmental and climatic impacts of vehicle operation on the environment by changes in the albedo of a vehicle roof is suggested. The proposed method allows to reduce the fuel consumption and greenhouse gases emission while idle with the engine running. The cost-effective modification in fuel quality using the microdose of the developed surface-active additive enables to reduce the specific fuel consumption dramatically, and substantially improves the environmental characteristics of vehicles operation. The combination of the proposed methods provides the opportunity for significant reduction of the GNG and toxic substances emissions by motor transport. © 2018 WIT Press.","Albedo; Climate change mitigation; Environmental impact assessment; Fuel consumption reduction; Mobility modification; Surface-active fuel additive; Vehicle operation",,,,"WITPress",1746448X,,,,"English","WIT Trans.

Objectives: This study compared the influence of newspaper framing on climate change mitigation in Nigeria and Ghana. It also assessed challenges editors’ face in reporting climate change. Methods: The contents of eight national newspapers for both countries were analysed and the news editors of the sampled newspapers were interviewed. Results: Findings showed that the issue of climate change was given less coverage and the dominant frame used in the Nigerian newspapers was the action frame, and environment frame for the Ghanaian newspapers, with floods as the prominent climate change issue reported in both countries. Factors identified include funding, the technicality of reporting climate change, none documentation and lack of expertise. Conclusion: There is also need for editors to look for ways in making climate change reports more interesting. © 2018, Union for African Population Studies.

Ecological restoration planning studies typically focus on biodiversity and ecosystem services, rather than employment and other co-benefits. Robust Offsetting (RobOff), a restoration planning tool, was used in a forest restoration project in Durban, South Africa, to plan forest restoration considering a mosaic of habitats with varying levels of degradation, diverse restoration actions, a limited budget and multiple (biodiversity, carbon stock and employment) goals. To achieve this, the restoration action currently being implemented (= current action) was compared to three restoration alternatives. The three restoration alternatives included (1) natural regeneration action;(2)carbon action;and(3)biodiversity action. The results supported biodiversity action as most beneficial in terms of maximizing biodiversity, carbon storage and job creation. Results showed that investing in biodiversity action is preferable to the status quo. RobOff ensured optimal allocation of limited resources to actions and habitats that have a potential to achieve higher biodiversity, carbon storage and job creation. © 2018 The Author(s).

They also argue that barriers analysis — a method widely employed both in scholarly climate change adaptation research and in national and international climate change assessments — should be replaced by approaches that remain untested in the context of climate change adaptation research, particularly in forestry adaptation and mitigation research. We believe that neither the scholarly research on adaptation and mitigation barriers nor our review have characteristics of functionalism or imply functionalist assumptions. Moreover, we disagree that barriers analysis can be replaced by the methodologies that they propose because these latter approaches address different aspects and features of processes supporting movement toward comprehensive and integrated adaptation and mitigation in forest management. We do agree that there are knowledge gaps relative to examinations and explanations of causal mechanisms to explain decision-making and policy process outcomes that have already occurred, and we encourage research to address these gaps.

Under “business as usual,” that situation is expected to continue for several decades. Using an electricity system planning model, this study investigates two complementary strategies to reduce CO2 emission intensity of the power sector in South Asia: carbon pricing, and expansion of cross-border electricity trade to exploit clean energy resources, especially hydropower. The study finds that with a carbon tax imposed on fossil fuels used for power generation, CO2 emissions from the power sector would be 10% lower than that in the baseline over 2015–2040 even if the cross-border electricity transmission capacity is not expanded from the current level. On the other hand, if the cross-border transmission capacity is expanded to facilitate unlimited power trading across countries, the carbon tax would cause 16% reduction of regional power sector CO2 emissions from the baseline. The regional electricity trade is not only beneficial economically as it saves almost US$100 billion electricity supply cost in the region over 2015–2040, but also an attractive option for climate change mitigation. The carbon tax would, however, increase the power supply cost and could adversely impact consumers unless the carbon tax revenue is used as a safeguard measure. Copyright 2018 by the IAEE.

The study finds that, even with a ratio of biomass to total feedstock less or equal to 10%, biomass co-firing can help achieve the climate policy goal of 2 °C temperature increase above the pre-industrial level by the end of the century at a lower cost. The policy cost can be further reduced if the ratio of biomass to total feedstock increases via technical progress or biomass supply increases. The study also shows that there is enough biomass potential from agriculture and forestry to progressively replace current nuclear energy supply with bioenergy from co-fired plants. However, replacing current nuclear energy supply with bioenergy produced from co-firing in order to deal with nuclear energy production safety concerns will lead to a high policy cost in terms of total GDP loss. The study finally reveals that future biomass trade from sub-Saharan Africa & Latin America to Europe, North America, and China may be needed for climate policy goals to be reached via biomass co-firing. © 2018, ICST Institute for Computer Sciences, Social Informatics and Telecommunications Engineering.","Global food price; Global woody biomass supply; Nuclear energy phase out","Biomass; Climate models; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Feedstocks; Forestry; Nuclear energy; Stabilization; Timber; Climate change mitigation; Electric power production; Energy productions; Food prices; Pre-industrial levels; Technical progress; Temperature increase; Woody biomass; Climate change","Egbendewe, A.Y.G.; Faculty of Economics and Management Sciences (FASEG), 01 BP 1515, Togo; email: emaklesso@gmail.com","Gueye A.Ndiaye A.Garba A.Kebe C.M.","Springer Verlag",18678211,9783319988771,,,"English","Lect.

However, over the last few years, particularly after the Paris Climate Agreement, carbon pricing has attracted much attention from national/sub-national governments, the corporate world and international development communities. More than 80 countries who signed the Paris Climate Agreement are considering carbon pricing as a potential option to achieve their GHG mitigation targets.

Climate-resilient and low-emission future can be built upon a long-term global goal for emission reductions. Reducing CO2 concentration in the atmosphere by enhancing the rates of removal of the atmospheric CO2 through carbon sequestration is considered as one of the best climate change mitigation strategy. Plants can sequester carbon through assimilation of carbohydrates in photosynthesis which will be stored in the biomass and will add to different pools of carbon subsequently. Farmers' adaptation to climate change-through changes in farming practices, cropping patterns, and use of new technologies will help to mitigate the adverse impact.

As with other IAMs, our approach ties economic activity with their externalities and feedback effects. We extend standard IAM methodologies to find the optimal allocation of infrastructure expenditure to carbon-neutral physical capital, climate change adaptation, and emissions mitigation. Optimal control solutions are obtained by discretizing the control problem and applying nonlinear programming methods. We demonstrate that the endogenously selected infrastructure shares out-perform fixed allocations by increasing consumption, private capital and tax revenue, while reducing public debt and CO2 emissions. We find 92–95% of spending should be allocated to physical infrastructure with the remainder going to mitigation and adaptation, for which the major part is used for adaptation. Further, homotopic analysis is conducted on unobservable parameters. We show that adaptation expenditure increases with the productive efficiency of non-renewables and emissions mitigation rises as its effect becomes nonlinear.

Oleaginous trees have potential to provide bioenergy supplies through biodiesel-producing seed yield as well as contributing to carbon sequestration. This paper aims to show the provisions of bioenergy and carbon savings through forest rotation management and it will investigate the potential of oleaginous forest management in China. We use the land expectation value (LEV) model to calculate the optimal joint values of timber, seed and total carbon savings, including carbon sequestration from forest and carbon reductions through energy substitutions. The results indicate that combining both values of seeds and carbon savings increase the LEV and rotation age (167,611 Yuan/ha, 78 years) compared to sole timber value (26,053 Yuan/ha, 55 years). The optimization of the LEVs and the resulting optimal rotation ages are significantly sensitive to the discounting rate. Annual biodiesel potential production from Pistacia chinensis can take up 1.7% of the national diesel consumption in China. We conclude that China can use improved forest rotation management as an effective means for achieving goals in its low-carbon energy strategy. © 2018 by the authors.

Burning begins at the onset of the dry season (November) and lasts until the end (April). This study investigated the effects of time of burning on tree diversity and density in the Mole National Park, Ghana. A total of 36 (10 m x 10 m) quadrats were randomly demarcated in three treatments of early and late dry season burning and non-burning study plots. Samples were taken in March, a few weeks after the late burning period. Twenty seven different species belonging to fourteen families were recorded in all the treatments. Most of the species identified belonged to the families Combretaceae, Fabaceae and Leguminoceae. Vitellaria paradoxa, Terminalia avicennioides, Combretum adenogonium and Combretum molle were the most common and abundant in all treatments. Late burning plots recorded the lowest diversity amongst the three treatments. Non-burning plots had higher tree density than burnt plots. Early burning treatment recorded more diverse individual species but had the lowest density. Higher tree densities would enhance carbon sequestration. However, ecosystem resilience is also dependent on the diversity of biotic communities among other factors. Sustainable land use practices including protections of trees on farms and prescribed early dry season burns could be an option to contribute to the mitigation of climate change in the region. Late dry season fires are a threat to tree species populations and should be discouraged. © 2018, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Burning frequency; Guinea savanna; Mole National Park; Species composition",,"Amoako, E.E.; Department of Ecotourism and Environmental Management University for Development Studies, P.O.

Practitioners in climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions are yet to exploit M & E to enhance effectiveness of their programmes. Objectives: This article underscores the critical role that M & E can and should play in enhancing effectiveness of climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions in developing countries. It provides a scholarly look at M & E and its visibility in climate change mitigation and adaptation work, the evidence of its role in mitigation and adaptation interventions across developing nations and the missing gaps in utilisation of M & E for mitigation and adaptation. This article presents key insights that practitioners need to design effective M & E systems for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Methods: The article was compiled based on Cooper's stages of literature review 1984. A total of 15 peer-reviewed articles, a few eBooks and hard copy textbooks as well as reports from credible international organisations that met the inclusion criteria of focus, goal and coverage on M & E and climate change mitigation and adaptation were reviewed. Results: The findings show that M & E can be used as an effective tool for learning, informing evidence-based decision-making, promoting accountability and helping organisations to improve on climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions. Conclusion: M & E if well designed and implemented can be handy and useful in informing climate change mitigation and adaptation interventions. © 2018.

Assessing the effects of future climate change on urban flood volumes is crucial to informing better management of such disasters given the severity of the devastating impacts of flooding (e.g. the 2016 flooding events across China). Although recent studies have investigated the impacts of future climate change on urban flooding, the effects of both climate change mitigation and adaptation have rarely been accounted for together in a consistent framework. In this study, we assess the benefits of mitigating climate change by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and locally adapting to climate change by modifying drainage systems to reduce urban flooding under various climate change scenarios through a case study conducted in northern China. The urban drainage model – Storm Water Management Model – was used to simulate urban flood volumes using current and two adapted drainage systems (i.e. pipe enlargement and low-impact development, LID), driven by bias-corrected meteorological forcing from five general circulation models in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 archive. Results indicate that urban flood volume is projected to increase by 52 % over 2020–2040 compared to the volume in 1971–2000 under the business-as-usual scenario (i.e. Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5). The magnitudes of urban flood volumes are found to increase nonlinearly with changes in precipitation intensity. On average, the projected flood volume under RCP 2.6 is 13 % less than that under RCP 8.5, demonstrating the benefits of global-scale climate change mitigation efforts in reducing local urban flood volumes. Comparison of reduced flood volumes between climate change mitigation and local adaptation (by improving drainage systems) scenarios suggests that local adaptation is more effective than climate change mitigation in reducing future flood volumes. This has broad implications for the research community relative to drainage system design and modelling in a changing environment. This study highlights the importance of accounting for local adaptation when coping with future urban floods. © Author(s) 2018.",,"Drainage; Floods; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Water management; Climate change mitigation; Climate change scenarios; Coupled Model Intercomparison Project; General circulation model; Low impact development; Meteorological forcing; Precipitation intensity; Storm water management model; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; CMIP; disaster management; flood; flooding; future prospect; general circulation model; global climate; greenhouse gas; precipitation intensity; urban area; urban drainage; China; Hohhot; Nei Monggol","Leng, G.; Joint Global Change Research Institute, United States; email: guoyong.leng@ouce.ox.ac.uk",,"Copernicus GmbH",10275606,,,,"English","Hydrol.

The focus is on Mediterranean cities, where, often, there is no regulation about these issues. Therefore, it is necessary to define resilience indicators through comparative studies of adaptive roof solutions to mitigate overheating in summer. Design/methodology/approach: Through software simulations and data comparison, a specific methodological approach is used to analyze the resilience levels of different roof solutions (phase change materials, aerogel, green and cool roof), starting from energy efficiency as a prerequisite of resilience. Moreover, a case study of a historic existing building in a southern Italian town is examined. Findings: The findings show the best strategies for building systems, especially for roofs, to decrease urban heat island effects according to the defined resilience indicators against overheating mitigation. Research limitations/implications: Other building systems, such as facades, also have to be investigated in relation to climate change mitigation. Practical implications: The implementation of resilient solutions that can also affect neighborhood for urban heat island mitigation. Social implications: Because of resilience indicators definition, it is easier to introduce economic incentives according to reference thresholds and to increase community involvement.

Given the high proportion of global emissions released by cities and the concentration of people living in urban areas, this will require an unprecedented reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and transformation of the built environment on a yet unparalleled timescale. This poses substantial challenges for urban land-use and transport planning and for the use of land-use transport models (LUTM), which have historically been developed to test incremental changes rather than the rapid transformations implied by the Paris Agreement. This paper sets out the need for a new generation of tools to support the planning of a transition toward a low-carbon and resilient future, arguing that land-use and transport modeling tools are crucial to support this process. Recent developments in urban integrated assessment that link models of land-use and transport with other environmental models of greenhouse gas emissions and climate hazards show promise as platforms to assess the potential of urban policies in achieving the goals set out in the Paris Agreement. The paper concludes by defining challenges for the LUTM community if it is to achieve these goals. Crucial will be the adoption of new modeling approaches to better represent rapid social and technological change and to concurrently assess the resilience and sustainability implications of different land-use and transport policies. Simple models to explore multiple scenarios of change must be integrated with more sophisticated models for detailed design.

Ambitions to limit global warming to 2 °C or even 1.5 °C could also lead to additional pressures from land-based mitigation measures such as bioenergy production and afforestation. To investigate these dynamics, this paper describes five elaborations of the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSP) using the IMAGE 3.0 integrated assessment model framework to produce regional and gridded scenarios up to the year 2100. Additionally, land-based climate change mitigation is modelled aiming for long-term mitigation targets including 1.5 °C. Results show diverging global trends in agricultural land in the baseline scenarios ranging from an expansion of nearly 826 Mha in SSP3 to a decrease of more than 305 Mha in SSP1 for the period 2010–2050. Key drivers are population growth, changes in food consumption, and agricultural efficiency. The largest changes take place in Sub-Saharan Africa in SSP3 and SSP4, predominantly due to high population growth. With low increases in agricultural efficiency this leads to expansion of agricultural land and reduced food security. Land use also plays a crucial role in ambitious mitigation scenarios. First, agricultural emissions could form a substantial component of emissions that cannot be fully mitigated. Second, bioenergy and reforestation are crucial to create net negative emissions reducing emissions in SSP2 in 2050 by 8.7 Gt CO2/yr and 1.9 Gt CO2/yr, respectively (1.5 °C scenario compared to baseline). This is achieved by expansion of bioenergy area (516 Mha in 2050) and reforestation. Expansion of agriculture for food production is reduced due to REDD policy (290 Mha in 2050) affecting food security especially in Sub-Saharan Africa indicating an important trade-off of land-based mitigation. This set of SSP land-use scenarios provides a comprehensive quantification of interacting trends in the land system, both socio-economic and biophysical. By providing high resolution data, the scenario output can improve interactions between climate research and impact studies. © 2017","Bioenergy; Climate change mitigation; Integrated assessment; Land-use change; REDD; Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs)","adaptive management; agricultural emission; agricultural land; agricultural performance; assessment method; bioenergy; climate change; emission control; food consumption; food production; food security; global warming; integrated approach; land use change; model; population growth; reforestation; scenario analysis; trend analysis; Sub-Saharan Africa","Doelman, J.C.; PBL Netherlands Environmental Assessment AgencyNetherlands; email: jonathan.doelman@pbl.bl",,"Elsevier Ltd",09593780,,GECHE,,"English","Global Environ.

The carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions associated with the burning of fossil fuels are on the rise due to growing electricity and transportation demand. In 2010, transportation accounted to 24.9% of total CO2 emissions and the number of vehicles registered in Mauritius has increased from 265,841 in 2002 to 384,115 in 2010 (Statistics Mauritius in Digest of environment statistics 2011, Mauritius, 2012). This is a highly unsustainable trend for both energy security and climate-related reasons. Therefore, an analysis of the approach to encourage and implement eco-driving, an important climate change mitigation measure, is a necessity for the island. This study aimed at developing an in-depth understanding of eco-driving, as a driver education initiative and as a climate change mitigating measure. A questionnaire was designed with the objectives of highlighting the key parameters that should be addressed in order to promote the concept of eco-driving in Mauritius. The findings of the survey first gave an insight of the willingness of drivers to adopt an eco-driving behaviour and identified the barriers that should be overcome so as to successfully implement eco-driving in Mauritius. In addition, a cost–benefit analysis was carried out to determine the extent to which implementing eco-driving will be cost-effective. An action plan of measures needed for implementing eco-driving in a timely manner was then proposed. The survey revealed that 68.1% respondents are willing to adopt eco-driving practices into their driving habits and only 45% respondents are willing to purchase and use an eco-driving device in their vehicles. It was observed that most drivers have little knowledge of eco-driving and they do not practice eco-driving frequently. Hypotheses were tested and it was shown that drivers are willing to adopt eco-driving behaviours but they are not willing to purchase an eco-driving device; at a confidence interval of 95%. Possible barriers to the implementation of eco-driving were highlighted from the survey. From the barrier analysis, a cost–benefit analysis was carried out to assess the cost-effectiveness of specific measures. The study identified measures, like conducting awareness campaigns on eco-driving, providing eco-driving training to different groups of drivers, giving subsidy to drivers for purchasing eco-driving feedback devices, investing in an eco-driving reference project and designing road layouts so as to encourage eco-driving. A benefit/cost ratio of 1.06 was obtained which means that it is worthwhile to go ahead with the project of implementing eco-driving in Mauritius. Besides, additional measures were recommended over a long-term basis, such as encouraging Public–Private Partnership to secure financial support and optimising traffic lights to enable eco-driving. The outcomes of this research work provide reassurance to the government that investing money for the implementation of eco-driving in Mauritius can reduce the country’s dependence on imported fuel and consequently, lowering the CO2 emissions from transport sector. In addition, eco-driving is associated with social benefits by enabling a safer and pleasant driving; ensuring community welfare. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Climate change; Eco-driving; Energy; Energy efficiency; Environment; Transport","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Driver training; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Highway planning; Sales; Surveys; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Eco-driving; Energy; Environment; In-depth understanding; Transport; Transportation demand; Climate change","Doorghen-Gorden, J.; United Nations Development Programme/Ministry of EnvironmentMauritius; email: d.joanna@hotmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",18653529,,,,"English","Green Energy and Technology",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032954899

The UNFCCC has traditionally divided the world into developed countries (including countries undergoing the process of transition to a market economy) and developing countries. It places the responsibility of reducing emissions with developed countries as if they were the only sinners of climate change. A better (and arguably fairer) way to tackle the climate change issue today is by bringing together the major GHG emitters, irrespective of their GDP. Why so? Because seen retrospectively, rich-countries have been (and continue to be) the major polluters; they are responsible for most of the GHG emissions, and have the financial and technological means to tackle climate change. However, seen prospectively, it is a developing countries problem, as predictions indicate that, in the near future, developing countries will be the major polluters as well as the major victims of the consequences of climate change, especially countries near the equator. The longer we wait, the harder and more expensive it will become to deal with climate change. So the major GHG emitters (whether developed or developing countries), which are responsible for historic, current and future emissions, should, therefore, be the ones to take action.The chapter concludes that no breakthroughs will take place regarding climate change mitigation until there is more political maturity on the side of the U.S. and until rapidly emerging economies indicate that they are ready to play their part. © 2018, Springer International Publishing AG.","Bottom-up approach to climate change mitigation; Major economies forum; Variable geometry","Commerce; Developing countries; Greenhouse gases; Network architecture; Climate change mitigation; Developed countries; Emerging economies; Major economies forum; Market economies; Reducing emissions; Trading systems; Variable geometry; Climate change","Leal-Arcas, R.; Centre for Commercial Law Studies, United Kingdom; email: r.leal-arcas@qmul.ac.uk",,"Springer Verlag",18653529,,,,"English","Green Energy and Technology",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032903159

This study presents a multi-stage joint-probabilistic left-hand-side chance-constrained fractional programming (MJCFP) approach to help tackle various uncertainties involved in typical electric power systems and thus facilitate risk-based management for climate change mitigation. The MJCFP approach is capable of solving ratio optimization problems associated with left-hand-side random information by integrating multi-stage programming method, joint-probabilistic chance-constrained programming, fractional programming into a general framework. It can balance dual-objectives of two aspects reflecting system optimal ratio and analyze many of possible scenarios due to various end-user demand situations during different periods. The MJCFP approach is implemented and applied to the provincial electric power system of Saskatchewan, Canada to demonstrate its effectiveness in dealing with the tradeoff between economic development and climate change mitigation. Potential solutions under various risk levels are obtained to help identify appropriate strategies to meet different power demands and emission targets to the maximum extent. The results indicate that the MJCFP approach is effective for regional electric power system planning in support of long-term climate change mitigation policies; it can also generate more alternatives through risk-based management, which allows in-depth analysis of the interrelationships among system efficiency, system profit and system-failure risk. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Electric power system planning; Fractional programming; Joint-probabilistic programming; Multi-stage; Risk-based management","Climate change; Computer programming; Constrained optimization; Electric power system economics; Electric power systems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Mathematical programming; Optimization; Risk assessment; Risk management; Systems engineering; Climate change mitigation; Fractional programming; Joint probabilistic; Multi stage; Risk-based managements; Electric power system planning","Huang, G.; Institute for Energy, Canada; email: gordon.huang@uregina.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030669206

In the context of climate change, these development needs are challenged by the vital goal of CO2 mitigation. This paper investigates plausible trade-offs between electrification and CO2 mitigation in a developing country context, taking Indonesia as a case study. Aligned with the 2015 Paris Agreement, the Government of Indonesia has announced its voluntary pledge to reduce 29% of its GHGs emissions against the business as usual scenario by 2030. 11% of this should be attained by the energy sector. We incorporate the Indonesian Paris pledge into the modelling of capacity expansion of the Java-Bali power system, which is the largest power system in Indonesia. The LEAP model is used for the analysis in this study. Firstly, we validate the LEAP model using historical data of the national electricity system. Secondly, we develop and analyse four scenarios of the Java-Bali power system expansion from the base year 2015 through to 2030. These include a reference scenario (REF) to reflect a continuation of the present energy mix (REF), then a shift from coal to natural gas (NGS) (natural gas), followed by an expansion of renewable energy (REN) and, finally, the least-cost option (OPT). The shift to natural gas decreases future CO2 emissions by 38.2 million ton, helping to achieve the CO2 mitigation target committed to. Likewise, an escalation of renewable energy development in the Java-Bali islands cuts the projected CO2 emissions by 38.9 million ton and, thus, assures meeting the target. The least-cost scenario attains the targeted emission reduction, but at 33% and 52% lower additional costs compared to NGS and REN, respectively. The cost-effectiveness of CO2 mitigation scenarios range from 14.9 to 41.8 US$/tCO2e. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Indonesia; LEAP; Paris agreement; Power sector; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy policy; Expansion; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Indonesia; LEAP; Power sector; Renewable energies; Climate change; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; electrification; emission control; energy resource; greenhouse gas; natural gas; power generation; renewable resource; rural area; trade-off; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Bali; Greater Sunda Islands; Indonesia; Indonesia; Java; Lesser Sunda Islands; Sunda Isles","Handayani, K.Room RA 1161, Ravelijn Building, P.O.

In the context of climate change, monospecific plantations might become an alternative to mitigate global warming; however, their contribution to the structural complexity, complementarity, and biodiversity of forests has not been addressed. Mixed forest plantations can ensure that objectives of climate change mitigation are met through carbon sequestration, while also delivering anticipated ecosystem services (e.g., nutrient cycling, erosion control, and wildlife habitat). However, mixed forest plantations pose considerable operational challenges and research opportunities. For example, it is essential to know how many species or functional traits are necessary to deliver a set of benefits, or what mixture of species and densities are key to maintaining productive plantations and delivering multiple ecosystem services. At the same time, the establishment of forest plantations in Mexico should not be motivated solely by timber production. Forest plantations should also increase carbon sequestration, maintain biodiversity, and provide other ecosystem services. This article analyzes some matters that affect the development of planted forests in the Mexican national context, and presents alternatives for forest resources management through the recommendation of mixed forest plantations as a means of contributing to climate change mitigation and the delivery of ecosystem services. © 2017 by the authors.","Forest management; Mexico; Mixed plantations; Multiple ecosystem services","Biodiversity; Ecology; Ecosystems; Forestry; Global warming; Technology transfer; Above and below-ground carbons; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem services; Forest resources managements; Me-xico; Mixed plantations; Operational challenges; Research opportunities; Climate change; climate change; ecosystem service; forest management; forest resource; forestry production; mixed forest; plantation forestry; temperate forest; tropical forest; Ecosystems; Forest Management; Plantations; Mexico [North America]","Guerra-De la Cruz, V.; Instituto Nacional de Investigaciones Forestales Agricolas y Pecuarias-Sitio Experimental TlaxcalaMexico; email: guerra.vidal@inifap.gob.mx",,"MDPI AG",19994907,,,,"English","Forests",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037524049

As they are recognized as important storage sites for carbon dioxide (CO2), which constitutes the primary greenhouse gas, biological C sequestration in woody plants is suggested as a potential mitigation tool for C emission reduction in cities. Despite this significant contribution of trees, they are not benefited sufficiently in developing countries due mainly to the lack of tree inventory data in urban ecosystems (streets, parks etc.) and inadequate knowledge about their potential in C mitigation. The aim of this paper is to put forward quantitatively the C sequestration and storage of a campus area, which is an important semi-public green area in Ankara's city center. Results of the study showed that in 2015 total sequestered CO2 in Ankara University's campus trees was 179,353.04 kg According to our calculations, the trees stored 1,608,132.39 kg CO2 since the establishment of the campus in 1942. © 2017 Parlar Scientific Publications.

In this paper, we are particularly interested in the role of environmental nongovernmental organizations (ENGOs) in this form of governance. The central question concerns how international ENGOs’ approaches to energy supply and climate mitigation can be understood as aligned with or dissenting from green governmentality. To approach this issue, we analyze the major energy reports of three international ENGOs – i.e. Friends of the Earth, Greenpeace, and WWF – focusing on their issue framings of future energy supply and climate change mitigation. We conclude that these ENGOs’ issue framings are aligned with green governmentality to varying degrees, involving the economization of environmental issues and the responsibilization and moralization of economic actions. These ENGOs also to varying degrees express opposition or resistance to this mode of governance, for example, by opening up the discussion of various aspects of responsibility, including both remedy and culpability. © 2017, Croatian Sociological Association.

We examine this claim, first for a typical CO2 capture and utilization (CCU) system producing methanol (MeOH), and then for a generalized system producing fuels from fossil carbon. The MeOH analysis shows CCU to be an inferior mitigation option compared to a system with CCS producing the same fuel without CO2 utilization. CCU also is far more costly. The generalized analysis further reveals that the mitigation potential of CCU for fuels production is limited to 50% of the original emissions of the reference system without CCU.

Through the investigation of eleven case studies, our research demonstrates the presence of these co-benefits where integration is observed. Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) is used to link observed input variables to identified co-benefits. This research suggests that integration is an effective means of generating co-benefits that contribute positively to project outcomes. The research further concludes that effective leadership support, either through public-private partnership and energy policy, is one means of achieving such explicit integration. Energy policy, in the form of voluntary instruments and incentives, is recommended to build necessary public-private partnerships and support leadership. Such policy recommendations have applications far beyond the energy sector and the lessons learned here can likely be applied to cases outside of it. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation and mitigation synergies; Canada; Climate change; Energy policy","Energy policy; Integration; Project management; Adaptation and mitigation synergies; Canada; Climate change adaptation; Explicit integration; Policy recommendations; Public private partnerships; Qualitative comparative analysis; Scientific uncertainty; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; comparative study; electricity industry; energy policy; integrated approach; mitigation; public-private partnership; qualitative analysis; research work; Canada","Hennessey, R.; Government of Yukon, 206A Lowe Street, Canada; email: ryan.hennessey@gov.yk.ca",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033661027

In the past few years, the number of local action plans towards climate change mitigation has been increasing, and it is essential to analyze their contribution to the achievement of global targets. Even if the relationship between local action plans and the reduction of energy use and GHG emissions is often assumed, this has not yet been validated nor quantified by empirical studies involving a large number of municipalities. Thus, the aim of this paper is to perform an empirical analysis on the link between local action plans and energy use and GHG emissions. The analysis is composed by a test of hypothesis and a regression analysis, performed for the municipalities of three European countries – Portugal, Sweden and United Kingdom. The main conclusion is that, in the context of these three countries, the analysis performed was not able to detect a significant impact related to the existence of local plans on GHG emissions. From the panel data regression analysis, it was possible to confirm that external factors, not directly related to local climate change mitigation actions, have a significant impact on GHG emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Causality test; Climate change mitigation; Local level policy","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Regression analysis; Causality test; Climate change mitigation; Empirical analysis; Empirical studies; European Countries; External factors; Test of hypothesis; United kingdom; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; empirical analysis; energy use; Granger causality test; greenhouse gas; local planning; regression analysis; Portugal; Sweden; United Kingdom","Azevedo, I.; University of Porto, Rua Dr. Roberto Frias., Portugal; email: up200301751@fe.up.pt",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033604197

However, this is compromised by insufficient information about the effectiveness of protected areas in increasing carbon storage, and the co-benefits of species and carbon conservation remain poorly understood. Here, we present the first rigorous quantitative assessment of the roles of giant panda nature reserves (NRs) in carbon sequestration, and explore the co-benefits of habitat conservation and climate change mitigation. Results show that more than 90% of the studied panda NRs are effective in increasing carbon storage, with the mean biomass carbon density of the whole NRs exhibiting a 4.2% higher growth rate compared with lands not declared as NRs over the period 1988-2012, while this effectiveness in carbon storage masks important patterns of spatial heterogeneity across the giant panda habitats. Moreover, the significant associations have been identified between biomass carbon density and panda's habitat suitability in 85% NRs and at the NR level. These findings suggest that the planning for carbon and species conservation co-benefits would enhance the greatest return on limited conservation investments, which is a critical need for the giant panda after its conservation status has been downgraded from ""endangered"" to ""vulnerable"". © 2017 The Author(s).",,"carbon; animal; bear; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem; endangered species; environmental protection; forest; metabolism; physiology; Animals; Carbon; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Endangered Species; Forests; Ursidae","Li, R.; Key Laboratory of Ecosystem Network Observation and Modeling, 11A Datun Road, China; email: renqiangli@igsnrr.ac.cn",,"Nature Publishing Group",20452322,,,"28983118","English","Sci.

However, urban planning policies that consider climate change mitigation have not been widely adopted, despite the issue's importance. To promote the consideration of climate change policies in urban planning, it is useful to identify the key determinants of effective climate change mitigation for policy makers. The objective of this study is therefore to identify the determining factors that affect changes in urban CO2 emissions based on city type using a dataset of metropolitan areas. We obtained data on 276 cities in 26 countries for the years 2000, 2005, and 2008. We divided the data into five regional groups and four clusters to control for the characteristics of metropolitan areas. The dataset includes urban CO2 emissions, GDP, and population. Three variables related to urban characteristics are subjected to determinants analysis using an econometric approach. The results show that the determinants of changes in urban CO2 emissions differ by city type and region. These results contribute to a better understanding of urban policies that can improve the effects of these driving factors by considering the characteristics of each city type. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Compact city; Metropolitan area; OECD; Urban characteristics; Urban policy","Carbon dioxide; Urban growth; Urban planning; CO2 emissions; Compact city; Metropolitan area; OECD; Urban characteristics; Urban policy; Climate change","Managi, S.; Urban Institute & Department of Urban and Environmental Engineering, Japan; email: managi.s@gmail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Every aspect of daily life in cities, which spans buildings, transit, food, energy, and water, relies on fossil fuels that materially contribute to climate change. This paper explores the need for research to better uncover the processes driving urbanization in order to develop novel ways to mitigate climate impacts on Earth. Areas of fruitful research include better quantification of teleconnections between cities and their hinterlands and coupling those to the socio-economic drivers and organization of those relationships; the financialization of much urban policy; understanding where cities fit in the global economic order and their role in generating economic growth, and the ways in which they are also seen as leaders of sustainability and climate actions, but constrained in so-doing by the nested and tiered layers of institutions they operate within.

We present a novel, simple methodology, to probe the potential global sustainability limits of bioenergy over time for energy provision and climate change mitigation using a complex-systems approach for assessing land-use dynamics. Primary biomass that could provide between 70 EJ year−1 and 360 EJ year−1, globally, by 2050 was simulated in the context of different land-use futures, food diet patterns and climate change mitigation efforts. Our simulations also show ranges of potential greenhouse gas emissions for agriculture, forestry and other land uses by 2050, including not only above-ground biomass-related emissions, but also from changes in soil carbon, from as high as 24 GtCO2eq year−1 to as low as minus 21 GtCO2eq year−1, which would represent a significant source of negative emissions. Based on the modelling simulations, the discussions offer novel insights about bioenergy as part of a broader integrated system. Whilst there are sustainability limits to the scale of bioenergy provision, they are dynamic over time, being responsive to land management options deployed worldwide. © 2017 The Authors.

We account for accumulation in abatement capital, greenhouse gases, and adaptation capital in order to better capture the arbitrage between abatement and adaptation investments. Pollution damages arise from the emissions due to the country consumption but also from the emissions of the rest of the world (ROW). A pollution threshold is then introduced, above which adaptation is no longer efficient. We obtain that if this threshold is lower than the steady-state level of pollution, there is no way for the modelled economy to avoid it. In particular, such a situation will appear if the ROW’s emissions are high. We then show that CDM may be a means to avoid a pollution threshold above which adaptation becomes of no use. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Adaptation; CDM; Climate change; Mitigation; Pollution threshold","Economics; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Pollution; Adaptation; Emissions reduction; Long term dynamics; Mitigation; Optimal adaptation; Pollution damage; Steady-state level; Climate change; abatement cost; adaptive management; capital; climate change; economic conditions; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; pollution; threshold","Pommeret, A.; SEE, Tat Chee avenue, Hong Kong; email: aude.pommeret@cityu.edu.hk",,"Springer Netherlands",09246460,,ERECE,,"English","Environ.

Ecosystem modelling and life cycle assessment tools were used to calculate the mitigation potential in substituting fossil materials and energy, expressed as the net CO2 exchange. Currently recommended management targeting to timber production acted as a baseline management. Alternative management included maintaining 20% higher or lower stocking in forests and final felling made at lower breast height diameter than used in the baseline. In alternative management scenarios, logging residues and logging residues with coarse roots and stumps were harvested in final felling in addition to timber. The net CO2 exchange in the southern and eastern sub-regions was higher compared to the western one due to higher net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) over the study period. Maintaining higher stocking with earlier final felling and intensified biomass harvest appeared to be the best option to increase both climate benefits and economic returns. Trade-offs between the highest net CO2 exchange and economic profitability of biomass production existed.

We show that how future population is valued importantly determines mitigation decisions. Using the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy model, we explore two approaches to valuing population: a discounted version of total utilitarianism (TU), which considers total wellbeing and is standard in social cost of carbon dioxide (SCC) models, and of average utilitarianism (AU), which ignores population size and sums only each time period’s discounted average wellbeing. Under both approaches, as population increases the SCC increases, but optimal peak temperature decreases. The effect is larger under TU, because it responds to the fact that a larger population means climate change hurts more people: for example, in 2025, assuming the United Nations (UN)-high rather than UN-low population scenario entails an increase in the SCC of 85% under TU vs. 5% under AU. The difference in the SCC between the two population scenarios under TU is comparable to commonly debated decisions regarding time discounting. Additionally, we estimate the avoided mitigation costs implied by plausible reductions in population growth, finding that large near-term savings ($billions annually) occur under TU; savings under AU emerge in the more distant future. These savings are larger than spending shortfalls for human development policies that may lower fertility. Finally, we show that whether lowering population growth entails overall improvements in wellbeing—rather than merely cost savings—again depends on the ethical approach to valuing population. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

However, the extent to which improvements can be made is dependent on the decision-making processes of individual producers, so there has been a proliferation of carbon accounting tools seeking to influence those processes. This paper evaluates the suitability of such tools for driving environmental change by influencing on-farm management decisions. Seven tools suitable for the European dairy industry were identified, their characteristics evaluated, and used to process data relating to six scenario farms, emulating processes undertaken in real farm management situations. As a result of the range of approaches taken by the tools, there was limited agreement between them as to GHG emissions magnitude, and no consistent pattern as to which tools resulted in the highest/lowest results. Despite this it is argued, that as there was agreement as to the farm activities responsible for the greatest emissions, the more complex tools were still capable of performing a ‘decision support’ role, and guiding management decisions, whilst others could merely focus attention on key issues. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon calculators; climate change mitigation; decision support; greenhouse gas emissions; livestock agriculture","accountability; agricultural emission; carbon emission; climate change; decision making; decision support system; emission inventory; environmental change; greenhouse gas; management practice; sustainable development","Green, A.; Agriculture & Environment Research Unit, United Kingdom; email: a.green@herts.ac.uk",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14735903,,,,"English","Int.

Adaptation studies of forestry practices have focused on maintaining the provisioning of ecosystem services; however, those practices may have implications for climate change mitigation as well by increasing biological sinks or reducing emissions. Assessments of the effectiveness of adaptation strategies to mitigate climate change are therefore needed; however, they have not been done for the world’s northern coniferous forests. Diversifying the forest by planting tree species more likely suited to a future climate is a potential adaptation strategy to increase resilience. The efficacy of this strategy to reduce the risks of climate change is uncertain, and other ecosystem services provided by the forest are also likely to be affected. We used a spatially explicit forest landscape modeling framework (LANDIS-II) to simulate the effects of planting a range of native tree species in colder areas than where they are currently planted in a managed temperate coniferous forest landscape in British Columbia, Canada. We investigated impacts on carbon pools, fluxes, tree species diversity, and harvest levels under different climate scenarios for 100 yr (2015–2115) and found that the capacity of our forest landscape to sequester carbon would largely depend on the precipitation rates in the future, rather than on temperature. We further found that, irrespective of the climate prediction model, current planting standards led to relatively low levels of resilience as indicated by carbon fluxes and stocks, net primary productivity (NPP), and species diversity. In contrast, planting a mix of alternative tree species was generally superior in increasing the resilience indicators: carbon stocks and fluxes, NPP, and tree species diversity, but not harvest rates. The second best novel planting regime involved adding Pinus contorta to the stocking standard in three ecoregions; however, that species is susceptible to a high number of insects and pathogens. We conclude that although the capacity of temperate coniferous forest landscapes to sequester carbon in the future is largely dependent on the precipitation regime, negative effects may be counteracted to some extent by increasing resilience through tree species diversity in forests. © 2017 Hof et al.","Assisted migration; Boreal forest; Carbon stocks; Climate change; Ecosystem services; Forestry; Modeling; Temperate forest",,,,"Ecological Society of America",21508925,,,,"English","Ecosphere",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035768051

Methods: A population-based, stratified and cross-sectional random digit dialling telephone survey study was conducted between January and February 2016, among the Cantonese-speaking population aged 15 and above in Hong Kong. Socio-demographic data and the self-reported practice of 10 different co-benefit behaviours were solicited. Ethics approval and participant’s verbal consent were sought. Findings: The study sample consisted of 1,017 respondents (response rate: 63.6%) were comparable to the age, gender and geographical distributions of the Hong Kong population found in the latest 2011 Hong Kong Population Census. Among the co-benefit behaviours, using less packaging and disposable shopping bags were practiced in the highest frequency (70.1%). However, four behaviours were found to have never been practiced by more than half of the respondents, including bringing personal eating utensils when dining in restaurants or small eateries, showering less than five minutes, having one vegetarian meal a week, and buying more organic food. Results of multivariable logistic regression showed that frequency of practicing co-benefit behaviours were consistently associated with gender and age. Conclusion: Urban residents in Hong Kong do not engage in the practice of co-benefit behaviours in a uniform way. In general, females and older people are more likely to adopt co-benefit behaviours in their daily lives. Further research to assess the knowledge and attitudes of the population towards these co-benefit behaviours will provide support to relevant climate change mitigation policies and education programmes. © 2017 Chan et al.

Previous studies have delved into the nature of dietary patterns, showing that GHG reductions can be achieved in diets if certain foods are consumed rather than other, more GHG intensive products. For instance, vegetarian and low-meat diets have proved to be less carbon intensive than diets that are based on ruminant meat. These environmental patterns, increasingly analyzed in developed nations, are yet to be assessed in countries liked Peru where food purchase represents a relatively high percentage of the average household expenditure, ranging from 38% to 51% of the same. Therefore, food consumption can be identified as a potential way to reduce GHG emissions in Peru. However, the Peruvian government lacks a specific strategy to mitigate emissions in this sector, despite the recent ratification of the Paris Accord. In view of this, the main objective of this study is to analyze the environmental impacts of a set of 47 Peruvian food diet profiles, including geographical and socioeconomic scenarios. In order to do this, Life Cycle Assessment was used as the methodological framework to obtain the overall impacts of the components in the dietary patterns observed and primary data linked to the composition of diets were collected from the Peruvian National Institute for Statistics (INEI). Life cycle inventories for the different products that are part of the Peruvian diet were obtained from a set of previous scientific articles and reports regarding food production. Results were computed using the IPCC 2013 assessment method to estimate GHG emissions. Despite variations in GHG emissions from a geographical perspective, no significant differences were observed between cities located in the three Peruvian natural regions (i.e., coast, Andes and Amazon basin). In contrast, there appears to be a strong, positive correlation between GHG emissions and social expenditure or academic status. When compared to GHG emissions computed in the literature for developed nations, where the average caloric intake is substantially higher, diet-related emissions in Peru were in the low range. Our results could be used as a baseline for policy support to align nutritional and health policies in Peru with the need to reduce the environmental impacts linked to food production. © 2017 Vázquez-Rowe et al.

This is a trend caused by the greening of the European power grid which is to be carbon neutral by 2050. As a part of this trend, the number of power-producing buildings is growing. Even in Norway, which has a highly centralized power production based on hydropower, buildings are increasingly equipped with solar power panels. The introduction of cross-sectoral innovations like power producing buildings is likely to encounter resistance, as the conventional system and its powerful actors are challenged. The strategies to either promote or block the growth of power producing buildings in Norway have been explored employing the Strategic Niche Management framework. For this paper, 32 interviews were conducted with decision-makers and experts, both advocates and opponents of power-producing buildings. It has been found that narratives have the potential to work as a bridging device between the niche and the regime. If the narrative supporting power-producing buildings should become a bridging device, it would have to address challenges as defined by the regime incumbents. In Norway, this would be equivalent to addressing the challenge of peak load. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bridging device; Empowerment; Narratives; Niche; Power-producing buildings; Resistance","Buildings; Carbon; Climate change; Decision making; Electric resistance; Fossil fuels; Solar energy; Bridging devices; Climate change mitigation; Decentralized power productions; Empowerment; European power grids; Narratives; Niche; Strategic niche management; Electric power transmission networks; building; climate change; empowerment; fossil fuel; renewable resource; solar power; Norway","Kvellheim, A.K.; SINTEF Building and Infrastructure, Høgskoleringen 7b, Norway; email: ann.kristin.kvellheim@ntnu.no",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034051737

However, the field has to date rather superficial in its appreciation of theoretical claims in well-being thought, with deep implications for the framing of mitigation priorities, policies, and research. Major strands of well-being thought are hedonic well-being—typically referred to as happiness or subjective well-being—and eudaimonic well-being, which includes theories of human needs, capabilities, and multidimensional poverty. Aspects of each can be found in political and procedural accounts such as the Sustainable Development Goals. Situating these concepts within the challenges of addressing climate change, the choice of approach is highly consequential for: (1) understanding inter- and intra-generational equity; (2) defining appropriate mitigation strategies; and (3) conceptualizing the socio-technical provisioning systems that convert biophysical resources into well-being outcomes. Eudaimonic approaches emphasize the importance of consumption thresholds, beyond which dimensions of well-being become satiated. Related strands of well-being and mitigation research suggest constraining consumption to within minimum and maximum consumption levels, inviting normative discussions on the social benefits, climate impacts, and political challenges associated with a given form of provisioning. The question of how current socio-technical provisioning systems can be shifted towards low-carbon, well-being enhancing forms constitutes a new frontier in mitigation research, involving not just technological change and economic incentives, but wide-ranging social, institutional, and cultural shifts.

However, the understanding of how best to integrate CCA&amp;M is limited despite the fact that there is an increasing interest, particularly in Southeast Asian countries, in achieving the integration. One such synergistic approach is to improve land-use with climate change consideration. This study aims to test this idea, conducting a pilot project with four local governments in the Silang-Sta. Rosa subwatershed of the Philippines, focusing on flood prevention that has strong spatial implications. The application of participatory watershed land-use management (PWLM), a systematic process with practical tools (e.g. scenario simulation, risk assessment), indicated that planned land-use conversion and projected climate change are likely to increase the intensity of flooding in the study area. Zoning enhancement is essential as a countermeasure. As one example, runoff neutral development measures would reduce the number of flood-affected people from approximately 226,410 to 183,349 in the future (year 2025), while preserving existing vegetation would prevent up to 528,142 tons of CO2 emissions. Illustrating the PWLM approach, this paper demonstrates the concrete use of scientific knowledge (i.e. flood hazard) for local planners to design climate change action. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate change; Flood; Integrated watershed management; Land-use; Local government; Management actions; Mitigation; Participatory GIS; Participatory watershed land-use management","Flood control; Floods; Land use; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Soil conservation; Urban planning; Water conservation; Water management; Watersheds; Adaptation; Integrated watershed management; Local government; Mitigation; Participatory GIS; Watershed lands; Climate change","Endo, I.; Institute for Global Environmental Strategies, 2108-11 Kamiyamaguchi, Japan; email: endo@iges.or.jp",,"Elsevier Ltd",22106707,,,,"English","Sustainable Cities Soc.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026897569

The objectives are also to determine policy implications and to recommend the specific contexts suitable for each modelling choice by using specific illustrative cases on biofuels. Methods: Consequential and attributional modelling approaches are chosen for life cycle greenhouse gas emission assessment of several bioenergy options. The assessed functional unit is 1 MJ of energy from molasses-based ethanol, palm-based biodiesel and electricity production from rice straw. The fossil fuel comparators are gasoline (for molasses-based ethanol), diesel (for palm-based biodiesel) and coal and gas (for rice straw). The substituted and substituting product systems are modelled under the global and national markets depending on the market delimitation of each product. Results and discussion: The climate change mitigation potentials when using different approaches are dissimilar, because the affected product systems being included in the analysis are not the same. The palm biodiesel could reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The molasses-based ethanol and rice straw-based electricity may or may not mitigate the climate change, since it depends on the methodological choices as well as the baseline situations of the product systems being investigated. The main characteristics of consequential modelling as additionality and the inclusion of only actually affected processes under market-based mechanisms while those of attributional modelling as specification and attribution/allocation have limitations. The limitations lead to potential risks on unintended and undesirable consequences (for the attributional model), unfairness and sub-optimisation (for the consequential model) in policy recommendations. Conclusions: This research clearly illustrates how certain modelling choices affect the climate change mitigation potentials of biomass-based fuels in comparison with fossil energy. Specific questions and conditions which could be more suitable for each modelling choice are addressed. The attributional modelling is more suitable for national environmental taxation and emission labelling/accounting for import-export, while the consequential modelling is more appropriate for new production development and eco-design. Due to the potential environmental risks arising from the modelling limitations, the consideration of both the widely applied approaches could support decisions more comprehensively. © 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.","Attributional modelling approach; Biofuel; Consequential modelling approach; Direct land use change; Indirect land use change","alcohol; biodiesel; biofuel; coal; fossil fuel; molasses; Article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; climate change; electricity; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; gas; life cycle; priority journal; strategic planning","Prapaspongsa, T.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Thailand; email: Trakarn.pra@mahidol.ac.th",,"Springer Verlag",09483349,,IJLCF,,"English","Int.

Green infrastructure has been identified as a critical strategy for stormwater management and flooding mitigation as well as for climate change adaptation. Climate science plays an important role in understanding a range of climate change impacts and the effects of green infrastructure for climate change planning. Nevertheless, a lack of down-scaled climate change data and place-based assessment has discouraged local communities to pursue further climate change plans. This study proposed a transdisciplinary planning framework assessing the effects of detention in mitigating climate change-induced flooding, using a case in the Charles River watershed, Massachusetts, USA. Derived from a climate sensitivity test in the watershed, 36 climate change conditions were modeled using Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) and compared to IPCC scenarios. Statistical analyses revealed that detention is more efficient in reducing flooding hazards in low and moderate emission scenarios than those at high emission scenarios. A range of extra land area designated for detention would be needed for mitigating floods under various climate change scenarios. Planning implications include the needs for effective siting of detention areas combined with soil conservation in watershed planning, innovations in adaptive land planning and urban design, and a call for an integration of climate science and hydrological assessment in the transdisciplinary planning processes to better inform and facilitate decision-making using green infrastructure for climate change adaptation in local communities. © 2017","Climate change adaptation; Climate change scenarios; Climate change-induced flooding; Green infrastructure; SWAT; Watershed planning","Decision making; Floods; Rain; Soil conservation; Urban planning; Watersheds; Climate change adaptation; Climate change scenarios; Green infrastructure; SWAT; Watershed planning; Climate change; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; decision making; environmental planning; flood control; flooding; greenspace; rainfall; soil and water assessment tool; urban design; urban planning; watershed; Charles River; Massachusetts; United States","Cheng, C.; The Design School, P.O.

As for much of the Mediterranean, average rainfall is predicted to decrease along with increasing seasonal and inter-annual variability and there is a need to understand how these changes will affect the sustainable use of groundwater resources. A density-coupled flow and transport model of the QS was used to simulate an ensemble of climate, water-use and adaptation scenarios from 2010 to 2099 taking into account intra- and inter-annual variability in recharge and groundwater use. By considering several climate models, bias correction and recharge calculation methods, a degree of uncertainty was included. Changes in rainfall regimes will have an immediate effect on groundwater discharge; however, the effect on saltwater intrusion is attenuated by the freshwater–saltwater interfaces’ comparatively slow rate of movement. Comparing the effects of adaptation measures demonstrates that the extent of intrusion in the QS is controlled by the long-term water budget, as the effectiveness of both demand and supply oriented measures is proportional to the change in water budget, and that to maintain the current position, average groundwater discharge should be in the order of 50 × 106 m3 yr−1. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Coastal aquifers; Numerical modelling; Portugal; Resource management; Salt-water/freshwater relations","annual variation; climate change; climate effect; coastal aquifer; discharge; numerical model; saline intrusion; seasonal variation; strategic approach; water management; Mediterranean Region; Portugal","Hugman, R.; Universidade do AlgarvePortugal; email: rthugman@gmail.com",,"Springer Verlag",14312174,,,,"English","Hydrogeol.

The 2°C target was confirmed and made legally binding in the Paris agreement at the “climate summit” (Conference of Parties 21, COP21) in December 2015. But despite agreement on the target, greenhouse-gas emissions are unlikely to fall soon and fast enough to meet the target, raising the question of whether this target needs to be revised or reinterpreted, and also of why there is insufficient cooperation toward emissions reduction despite the risk of dangerous climate change. Previous theoretical and experimental research has suggested that cooperation towards emissions reduction is undermined by uncertainty about the threshold marking the transition to dangerous climate change. However, even if the threshold and hence the location of the target are known precisely, uncertainty ensues because of an unknown risk that arises from missing the collective target. How humans deal with this risk has not been investigated experimentally. Here we investigate how individuals behave under different risk scenarios if a collective target is missed. We perform economics experiments framed as a collective-risk social dilemma and directly examine the extent to which human subjects trade pay-out reduction for risk. We show that a reduced assessed risk arising from missing the collective target leads to reduced contributions towards the target; but that risk reduction causes the subjects almost to maximize their individual pay-out by balancing the effort to reach the target against the risk posed by missing it. We provide quantitative support for the argument that group contributions toward the collective target can be interpreted as proportional to mitigated warming. We conclude that reinterpretation of the 2°C target as less strict causes additional warming. However, our subjects deal effectively with a risk of dangerous climate change that they assess to depend gradually on global warming. Our results suggest that, if the additional warming is judged to be acceptable, a less strict interpretation of the 2°C target might support finding a trade-off between the effort put into climate mitigation and the risk of dangerous climate change. © 2017, The Author(s).",,,"Marotzke, J.; The Ocean in the Earth System, Germany; email: jochem.marotzke@mpimet.mpg.de",,"Palgrave Macmillan Ltd.",20551045,,,,"English","Palgrave Commun.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055789315

Changes in vector-borne disease impacts are often linked to human modification of ecosystems as well as climate change. For tropical ecosystems, the health impacts of future environmental and developmental policy depend on how vector-borne disease risks trade off against other ecosystem services across heterogeneous landscapes. By linking future socio-economic and climate change pathways to dynamic land use models, this study is amongst the first to analyse and project impacts of both land use and climate change on continental-scale patterns in vector-borne diseases. Models were developed for cutaneous and visceral leishmaniasis in the Americas—ecologically complex sand fly borne infections linked to tropical forests and diverse wild and domestic mammal hosts. Both diseases were hypothesised to increase with available interface habitat between forest and agricultural or domestic habitats and with mammal biodiversity. However, landscape edge metrics were not important as predictors of leishmaniasis. Models including mammal richness were similar in accuracy and predicted disease extent to models containing only climate and land use predictors. Overall, climatic factors explained 80% and land use factors only 20% of the variance in past disease patterns. Both diseases, but especially cutaneous leishmaniasis, were associated with low seasonality in temperature and precipitation. Since such seasonality increases under future climate change, particularly under strong climate forcing, both diseases were predicted to contract in geographical extent to 2050, with cutaneous leishmaniasis contracting by between 35% and 50%. Whilst visceral leishmaniasis contracted slightly more under strong than weak management for carbon, biodiversity and ecosystem services, future cutaneous leishmaniasis extent was relatively insensitive to future alternative socio-economic pathways. Models parameterised at narrower geographical scales may be more sensitive to land use pattern and project more substantial changes in disease extent under future alternative socio-economic pathways. © 2017 Purse et al.

The Mexico 2050 Calculator was used to run a number of low carbon future scenarios by 2050. The calculator consists of a whole-systems model, which combines the main sectors of the Mexican economy into a single visual tool. By integrating energy and carbon dynamics across all sectors and carrying out a sensitivity analysis of the entire model, we compare four low carbon energy scenarios to assess current energy policy strategies in the country.

With exceptionally large specific surface area and highly interconnected pore networks, 3D graphene scaffolds manifest extraordinary nanoscale effects that result in materials with unusual electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical properties. A global multidisciplinary research effort focusing on the development of innovative 3D GBMs with hierarchical microstructures and novel functionalities has therefore recently emerged. This review provides a comprehensive account of the key design principles in preparing high performance 3D GBMs and discusses their application as advanced electrode materials in a range of energy storage and conversion devices, including lithium-ion batteries, supercapacitors, fuel cells, dye-sensitized solar cells, and photoelectrochemical water splitting units. In addition, the review provides insights into newer and emerging sustainable energy applications of 3D GBMs, such as adsorbents for high-density hydrogen storage and selective capture of CO2 from flue gases, as well as catalysts for photoconversion of CO2 into clean fuels and value-added chemicals. The current state of knowledge is highlighted for each of the applications, followed by a discussion of our own perspectives on each topic.

Due to this effect, the comfort conditions of the citizens deteriorate. In the case of the city of Seville (Spain), several models of climate change forecast increases in the maximum temperatures ranging from 1.5 to 6 °C in summer. This article explores the role of green roofs as a supplement to the green spaces of the city, in order to buffer the negative effects of the increase of the maximum temperatures due to climate change. Images from the Landsat 7 ETM+ and Sentinel-2 satellites have been used in order to verify the inverse relationship between land surface temperature and the abundance of vegetation, expressed by the normalized difference vegetation index. For Seville, a green roof surface of 740 ha should be implemented, in the most adverse scenario, which means covering 40.6% of the existing buildings. In the most optimistic scenario, the forecasted green roof surface required is 207 ha (11.3% of the roofs). © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Heat island; Normalized difference vegetation index; Remote sensing; Urban greening","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Landforms; Remote sensing; Roofs; Vegetation; Climate change mitigation; Comfort conditions; Heat island; Inverse relationship; Land surface temperature; Maximum temperature; Normalized difference vegetation index; Urban greening; Climate change; climate change; environmental planning; garden; greenspace; heat island; land surface; Landsat; NDVI; remote sensing; roof; satellite imagery; Sentinel; urban planning; Andalucia; Sevilla; Seville; Spain","Pérez-Urrestarazu, L.; Urban Greening & Biosystems Engineering Research Group, Ctra.

We used a process-based dynamic tropical peatland model to explore peat carbon (C) dynamics of several management scenarios within the context of simulated twenty-first century climate change. Simulations of all scenarios with land use, including restoration, indicated net C losses over the twenty-first century ranging from 10 to 100 % of pre-disturbance values. Fire can be the dominant C-loss pathway, particularly in the drier climate scenario we tested. Simulated 100 years of oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) cultivation with an initial prescribed burn resulted in 2400–3000 Mg CO2 ha−1 total emissions. Simulated restoration following one 25-year oil palm rotation reduced total emissions to 440–1200 Mg CO2 ha−1, depending on climate. These results suggest that even under a very optimistic scenario of hydrological and forest restoration and the wettest climate regime, only about one third of the peat C lost to the atmosphere from 25 years of oil palm cultivation can be recovered in the following 75 years if the site is restored. Emissions from a simulated land degradation scenario were most sensitive to climate, with total emissions ranging from 230 to 10,600 Mg CO2 ha−1 over 100 years for the wettest and driest dry season scenarios, respectively. The large difference was driven by increased fire probability. Therefore, peat fire suppression is an effective management tool to maintain tropical peatland C stocks in the near term and should be a high priority for climate mitigation efforts. In total, we estimate emissions from current cleared peatlands and peatlands converted to oil palm in Southeast Asia to be 8.7 Gt CO2 over 100 years with a moderate twenty-first century climate. These emissions could be minimized by effective fire suppression and hydrological restoration. © 2016, The Author(s).","Carbon dynamics; Oil palm; Peatland rewetting; Peatlands; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD)","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sequestration; climate change; cultivation; deforestation; ecosystem management; emission control; environmental restoration; land degradation; land use; monocotyledon; peat; peatland; rewetting; tree; tropical environment; twenty first century; Southeast Asia; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis","Warren, M.; USDA Forest Service, 271 Mast Rd., United States; email: mwwarren@fs.fed.us",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

The current risk category of dangerous warming is extended to more categories, which are defined by us here as follows: &gt;1.5 °C as dangerous; &gt;3 °C as catastrophic; and &gt;5 °C as unknown, implying beyond catastrophic, including existential threats. With unchecked emissions, the central warming can reach the dangerous level within three decades, with the LPHI warming becoming catastrophic by 2050. We outline a three-lever strategy to limit the central warming below the dangerous level and the LPHI below the catastrophic level, both in the near term (&lt;2050) and in the long term (2100): the carbon neutral (CN) lever to achieve zero net emissions of CO2, the super pollutant (SP) lever to mitigate short-lived climate pollutants, and the carbon extraction and sequestration (CES) lever to thin the atmospheric CO2 blanket. Pulling on both CN and SP levers and bending the emissions curve by 2020 can keep the central warming below dangerous levels. To limit the LPHI warming below dangerous levels, the CES lever must be pulled as well to extract as much as 1 trillion tons of CO2 before 2100 to both limit the preindustrial to 2100 cumulative net CO2 emissions to 2.2 trillion tons and bend the warming curve to a cooling trend. © 2017, National Academy of Sciences.

The Brazilian government plans to reduce national GHG emissions by at least 36%, partly by reducing emissions in the livestock sector through strategies such as intensification, pasture improvement, and rotational grazing. In response, sustainability programs promoting these practices have begun operation. Though studies have previously investigated aspects of GHG emissions and sequestration in improved pastures, they have not linked improvements with programmatic interventions. We surveyed 40 cattle ranchers located in the Brazilian Amazon biome to investigate how GHG emissions differed between farms participating in livestock sustainability programs with intensified production and farms not participating in these programs. We found that participating farms produced 8.3 kg of CO2e/kg of carcass weight (CW) less than did non-participating farms, which represents 19% fewer emissions. Farms that had participated in a sustainability program for at least two years showed larger differences in emissions: 19.0 kg of CO2e/kg CW less for program farms compared with their counterparts, or 35.8% fewer emissions. Key drivers of the total CO2e/kg CW in all farms were enteric fermentation and manure management. This paper provides farm-level data supporting intensification as a possible strategy to reduce emissions per kilogram of beef produced, and suggests that future research efforts should focus on long-term impacts of intensification and expand metrics for success beyond GHG calculations. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Beef; Brazil; Certification; Intensification; Livestock emissions; Sustainability","Agriculture; Beef; Climate change; Deforestation; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Sustainable development; Brazil; Certification; Climate change mitigation; Enteric fermentation; Intensification; Pasture management; Reducing emissions; Sustainability project; Greenhouse gases","Newton, P.; Environmental Studies Program, UCB 397, 4001 Discovery Drive, United States; email: peter.newton@colorado.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

How the technologies affect firm performance is a research issue of great importance to firm managers and policymakers. Using a dataset on major United States manufacturing firms, this study identifies five types of climate change mitigation technologies: eco-efficiency, low-carbon energy, green design, pollution control, and management system. This paper develops measures to capture the firms' unified (operational and environmental) performance using data envelopment analysis, and examines the effects of different climate change mitigation technologies on the unified performance. The research finds that the adoption of low-carbon energy technology positively and significantly affects the unified performance, whereas the adoption of pollution control technology has a significantly negative effect. Moreover, increasing the share of investment in low-carbon energy out of total technology investment can positively and significantly affect the unified performance, and the share of pollution control has a negative and significant effect.

The feasibility study considers both technical and economic aspects. In particular, the energy retrofit strategies are focused on the use of materials and products recyclable or otherwise arising from sustainable processes in order to ensure the requirements of the Kyoto Fund. The design strategies and methodology adopted for the retrofit of the school allowed to improve building's energy class from D to A4, with a considerable saving of energy needs from 104,50 kWh/m2 to 4,80 kWh/m2, with high return on reasonable short-term investment, as well as meaningful reduction of CO2 emissions (90%).","Energy efficiency; Energy Saving; Kyoto Fund; School; School Retrofitting","Climate change; Energy conservation; Investments; Public administration; Retrofitting; Central government; Climate change mitigation; Educational buildings; Feasibility studies; Kyoto Fund; Materials and products; School; Sustainable process; Kyoto fund; Energy efficiency","Nocera, F.; University of Catania, Viale A.

In some climate-change mitigation policies, industries and individuals can purchase offsets that compensate for their greenhouse-gas emissions by reducing emissions elsewhere. However, offsets may undermine mitigation efforts, by potentially giving carbon credits for emissions reductions that would have occurred even without the offset program in place. We evaluate California's forest offset program – the first-ever legally enforceable “compliance” offset program for existing forests – to determine whether offsets (1) provide additional emissions reductions that would not have occurred without the program (called “additionality”) and (2) yield other benefits. We found that California's forest offset program, comprising a small portion of the state's mitigation portfolio, does not inhibit overall emissions reductions. Further, the program advances stringent “additionality” of emissions reductions through multiple mechanisms. Finally, mitigation through forest offsets can yield a suite of important co-benefits. Lessons from California's experience with forest offsets can help to inform other offset programs that are increasingly being developed around the world. © The Ecological Society of America",,"carbon emission; climate change; compliance; conservation; emission control; forest ecosystem; greenhouse gas; California; United States","Anderson, C.M.; Emmett Interdisciplinary Program in Environment and Resources, United States; email: andersn@stanford.edu",,"Wiley Blackwell",15409295,,,,"English","Frontiers Ecol.

The Leakage Risk Monetization Model was used to estimate the costs of leakage for representative CO2 injection scenarios, and these costs were incorporated into the Global Change Assessment Model. Worst-case scenarios of CO2 leakage risk, which assume that all leakage pathway permeabilities are extremely high, were simulated. Even with this extreme assumption, the associated costs of monitoring, treatment, containment, and remediation resulted in minor shifts in the global energy system. For example, the reduction in CCS deployment in the electricity sector was 3% for the “high” leakage scenario, with replacement coming from fossil fuel and biomass without CCS, nuclear power, and renewable energy. In other words, the impact on CCS deployment under a realistic leakage scenario is likely to be negligible. We also quantified how the resulting shifts will impact atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Under a carbon tax that achieves an atmospheric CO2 concentration of 480 ppm in 2100, technology shifts due to leakage costs would increase this concentration by less than 5 ppm. It is important to emphasize that this increase does not result from leaked CO2 that reaches the land surface, which is minimal due to secondary trapping in geologic strata above the storage reservoir. The overall conclusion is that leakage risks and associated costs will likely not interfere with the effectiveness of policies for climate change mitigation. © 2017, The Author(s).","Carbon capture, utilization and storage; Carbon tax; Climate change mitigation; GCAM; Geologic CO2 storage; Integrated assessment modeling; Leakage risk; Representative concentration pathways","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Fossil fuels; Nuclear fuels; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Carbon taxes; Climate change mitigation; CO2 storage; GCAM; Integrated assessment models; Representative concentration pathways; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; cost analysis; environmental economics; environmental modeling; environmental risk; fossil fuel; leakage; pollution tax; renewable resource","Deng, H.; Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, United States; email: hangdeng310@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

In this study, we integrate various foresight methods in analysing the future of the sawmilling industry in Finland. According to the results, climate change mitigation policies impact firstly through increasing energy costs and secondly through emerging energy products. The greatest uncertainties are related to the price of energy and the competitive situation of wood as a potential source of energy, both regulated heavily by EU- and national-level policies. In addition, the future development of biorefineries was regarded as a potential driver of change: the increasing demand for pulpwood would increase competition for the raw materials. From a managerial perspective, the Finnish sawmilling industry should thus consider adoption of new business models for joint production of wood, chips, and energy for heat and power.

Losses on ignition and the Walkley–Black method were used to estimate biomass and soil carbon stock, respectively. The carbon stock of trees was estimated using an allometric equation. The results revealed that the total carbon stock of the forest was 639.87 t/ha whereas trees store 406.47 t/ha, litter, herbs, and grasses (LHGs) 2.58 t/ha and soil 230.82 t/ha (up to 30 cm depth).

Schwerhoff lists three reasons for improved mitigation: reciprocal behaviour by the followers, an increase in the perceived value of climate change mitigation and reductions in costs. I will show several shortcomings in these mechanisms. In addition, I will survey other mechanisms that suggest an adverse effect of leadership on mitigation by other nations. These include free-riding and carbon leakage. The effect of these mechanisms possibly dominates the positive effect of leadership. The leadership role in itself is not projected to increase climate change mitigation in following countries.

This paper provides a first estimate of the potential for mitigation in the whole Spanish agriculture. A set of mitigation measures are selected for their cost-effectiveness and abatement potential and an efficient mix of these measures is identified with reference to a social cost of carbon of 40 €/tCO2e. This mix of measures includes adjusting crop fertilization and managing forests for carbon sequestration. Results indicate that by using the efficient mix of mitigation measures the annual abatement potential could reach 10 million tCO2e, which represents 28% of current agricultural emissions in Spain. This potential could further increase if the social cost of carbon rises covering the costs of applying manure to crops. Results indicate also that economic instruments such as input and emission taxes could be only ancillary measures to address mitigation in agriculture.

Climate change poses serious threat to urban infrastructure, quality of life, and entire urban systems. Cities need to adopt an integrated approach for improvement of city services in order to adapt to climate change and reduce their greenhouse emissions. However, the magnitude of investment required to bridge the widening infrastructure service provision demand-supply gap along with the additional investment to mitigate climate change demands the need to look for innovative financing solutions. Private investments through public private partnership (PPP) route offer an innovative mechanism for meet both the goals of infrastructure development and climate change mitigation. Private parties in PPP, however, focuses on the project economics only though they have the potential to provide innovative technical, financial and managerial solutions. The paper aims to answer the question how to integrate climate change mitigation objective in procurement process of PPP projects. The study has focused only on PPP projects in Municipal Solid Waste Management sector. The integration of climate change mitigation objective has been through design of a modified procurement protocol which promote private sector to devise project structure that fulfil both the objectives of climate change mitigation and provision of quality infrastructure services. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2017.",,"Economics; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Internet protocols; Investments; Municipal solid waste; Sustainable development; Waste management; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse emissions; Infrastructure development; Infrastructure services; Integrated approach; Procurement process; Public private partnerships; Urban infrastructure; Climate change","Laishram, B.; Infrastructure Engineering and Management Division, India; email: boeing@iitg.ernet.in","Barakat S.Maalej M.Al-Ruzouq R.Hamad K.Shanableh A.Al-Toubat S.Omar M.","EDP Sciences",2261236X,,,,"English","MATEC Web Conf.",Conference Paper,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028087570

In this work, we assess the effects of different soil management practices (conventional tillage, CT, reduced tillage, RT, reduced tillage plus green manure, RTG, and no tillage, NT) on soil CO2 flux dynamics and carbon sequestration in two organic rainfed almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) orchards under semiarid conditions. Soil CO2 flux, temperature, and moisture were measured monthly over two-three years, and shortly after tillage operations. The soil aggregation distribution (including micro-aggregates occluded within macro-aggregates) and associated organic carbon content were measured after four years of implementation. No significant differences in CO2 emissions among the soils subjected to the distinct management practices were observed at either site. On the one hand, shifting from CT to RT or RTG increased the OC content by 56% on average in all aggregate sizes. On the other hand, suppressing tillage only increased the OC content (by 24%) in the macro-aggregates. Moreover, improved soil management practices modulated the response of soil CO2 flux to temperature and moisture in these semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems. According to our results, soil CO2 flux under the conventional tillage treatment was more sensitive to temperature increments than with the reduced tillage treatments, indicating that bare soils will be more vulnerable to organic carbon mineralization with ongoing global warming. On the contrary, the incorporation of plant residues under the reduced tillage treatments promoted soil aggregation and organic carbon preservation, making soils more resilient to abrupt changes in temperature and moisture under these treatments. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Almond orchards; Carbon sequestration; Cover crop mulches; Improved soil management; Occluded micro-aggregates; Soil CO2 emissions","agricultural ecosystem; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; cover crop; Mediterranean environment; mulch; orchard; plant residue; semiarid region; soil aggregate; soil emission; soil moisture; soil organic matter; tillage; Prunus dulcis","Almagro, M.; Soil and Water Conservation Department, PO Box 164, Spain; email: mbonmati@cebas.csic.es",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678809,,AEEND,,"English","Agric.

Under this strategy, a dynamic, recursive computable general equilibrium (CGE) model is used to analyze the economy, energy, and environment impact of CO2 emission reduction policy based on 17 scenarios in China: carbon tax, emission trading scheme (ETS), and the mixed policy in different price level, in order to find out which kind of emission reduction strategy is more feasible. The results show that CO2 emission in 2030 will be reduced with the implementation of tax, ETS and mixed policy, by 10–13 %, 12–14 %, and 18–28 %, respectively. From 2016 to 2030, China can reduce 18,338–24,156 Mt CO2 through the implementation of mixed policy. Furthermore, relative to single policy, mixed policy has stronger effects on primary energy consumption cut, by 738–1124 Mtoe or 18–28 %, which will make CO2 emissions reach a peak before 2030 and the peak emission is not greater than 12 billion tons which is in line with the reduction demand in China. Thus, the mixed policy is the most effective strategy so that mixed policy is recommended to parties included in Annex I in United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Kyoto Protocol and other countries with large potential of emission reduction, while ETS is suggested to countries with low carbon emissions per capita which can balance economic development and CO2 mitigation. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Carbon tax; Climate change; Computable general equilibrium (CGE) model; Emission trading scheme (ETS); Energy consumption; Mitigation strategy; Mixed policy","adaptive management; carbon dioxide; climate change; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic development; emissions trading; energy use; environmental impact; Kyoto Protocol; policy analysis; policy implementation; pollution tax; China","Li, W.; Philosophy and Social Science Research Base of Hebei Province, China; email: ncepulw@126.com",,"Springer Netherlands",13812386,,MASCF,,"English","Mitigation Adapt.

Therefore, to mitigate climate change is of great importance for the sustainability of tourism. Yet extant studies regarding tourism and climate change tend to be dominated by a supply-side stance, albeit the core role of the tourist in the tourism industry. While researchers are increasingly adopting a tourist perspective, few seek to understand the linkage between climate change and tourists' specific mitigation behaviors in a tourism context; this is especially so in China. This study investigates the impact of Chinese tourists' perceptions of climate change on their mitigation behaviors based on norm activation theory. Drawing on 557 self-administrated questionnaires collected in China, it finds that tourists' perceptions of climate change and perceived contribution of tourism to climate change both positively affect energy saving and carbon reduction behavior in tourism. Yet, compared with perceived contribution of tourism to climate change, tourists' perceptions of climate change are found to be a much stronger predictor for energy saving and carbon reduction behavior. Therefore, it suggests that tourists' perceptions of climate change in a general context is more strongly related to climate change mitigation behavior in tourism, calling for attention to go beyond the tourism context to alleviate the negative impacts of tourism on climate change. ©.","Chinese tourist; Climate change; Energy saving and carbon reduction behavior; Norm activation theory","climate change; emission control; industrial development; perception; sustainability; tourism; tourism development; China","Gao, J.; Waikato Management School, New Zealand; email: jun.gao@waikato.ac.nz",,"MDPI AG",20711050,,,,"English","Sustainability",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026653042

The feasible innovative methods and technologies are in demand to overcome global warming. The three major concerns for the planet are related to energy, the environment, and food, and they can be solved through the use of microalgae if exploited in a well-balanced and cost-effective manner with synergistic approaches. Microalgal technologies are gradually realizing the potential of CO2 capture through mass cultivation using wastewater/flue gases, etc. Its biomass could be used as an energy feedstock (biodiesel, bioethanol, biohydrogen, biogas, etc.) integrated with high-value products such as PUFA (polyunsaturated fatty acids, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acids), DHA (docosahexaenoic acids), pigments (phycobiliproteins), carotenoids, etc. In addition, there is a vast scope for making a complete biorefinery system initiating from cultivation of microalgae by utilizing wastewater and flue gases at nonfertile unutilized lands. Microalgal carbon fixation and carbon-concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) in global climate change scenarios are not yet fully understood for decision making on their adaptation, future community changes, feedback to global emissions and associated implications in ecosystems services. In addition, many facets of CCMs and carbon sequestration process needs to be investigated for the integrated carbon capture and biorefinery projects.

Based on the self-developed US Policy Assessment Model, this paper systematically evaluates the three potential “major deficits” in terms of mitigation, climate finance, and global climate governance, as a result of the US withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and puts forward policy suggestions for coping with such transformations accordingly. The study shows that the United States ’withdrawal from the Paris Agreement will affect the existence and implementation of successive climate policies and result in an additional 8.8–13.4% increase in the global emissions reduction deficit. The United States’ withdrawal will also deteriorate the existing climate finance mechanism. The Green Climate Fund (GCF)’s funding gap will increase by US$2 billion, while the gap of long-term climate finance will increase by about US$5 billion a year. Either the China–EU or the “BASIC plus” mechanism could fill the governance deficit caused by the United States and the lack of political momentum may continue for a while in the future. © 2017 Shandong Normal University.","finance deficit; global climate governance deficit; mitigation deficit; Paris Agreement; Trump administration",,"Fu, S.; Department of International Cooperation, China; email: Fusha216@outlook.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",10042857,,,,"English","China Popul.

This comparison reveals wide variations in the types of targets, with the ""ambition"" level changing as the perspective changes from total CO2 to CO2/capita and per unit gross domestic product (GDP).We also review national plans as stated in NDCs and find that while there are many types of policies listed, few are quantified and no attempts are made to score individual or groups of policies for their likelihood in achieving stated targets.

However, so far a systematic application to climate policy (CP) does not exist. One important postulation of PT is that outcomes are perceived as gains or losses, relative to the reference point. When it comes to CP, different decision-makers may have different reference points. For example, one decision-maker perceives the current climate as the reference point whereas another decision-maker may have another one, say climate in 100 years. For the former, climate damages are losses and the benefits of CP are reductions of losses. For the latter, benefits of CP are gains. PT suggests that the former places a higher value in CP than the latter. After a critical review whether and how PT may be applied to CP, the paper systematically presents this and other cases where PT offers new insights into climate-related analyses, notwithstanding the importance of well-known aspects such as discounting, altruism, political and economic costs. It is shown that accounting for PT may contribute to a better understanding of some well-known puzzles in the climate debate, including different preferences for CP amongst individuals and nations, the role of technical vs. financial adaptation, and the apparent preference for hard protection measures in coastal adaptation. Finally, concrete possibilities for empirical research on these effects are proposed. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptation; climate change; mitigation; prospect theory; reference dependence","Decision making; adaptation; Adaptation to climate changes; Decision makers; Empirical research; mitigation; Prospect theory; reference dependence; Reference points; Climate change","Osberghaus, D.; Centre for European Economic Research (ZEW)Germany; email: osberghaus@zew.de",,"Routledge",13669877,,,,"English","J.

These crises prompted tremendous national and international response, and triggered the Government of Pakistan to establish new institutions, policies, strategies and action plans. Donors, humanitarian and development organisations, however, tend to follow their own policies, plans and interests, which may be quite different from the government entities dealing with humanitarian efforts, climate change and disaster. To what extent do these different perspectives affect the ability of the government to respond effectively and coordinate with humanitarian and development organisations during different phases of a crisis? This article examines the existing institutions, policies and perspectives that guide how government, humanitarian and development organisations, and community members understand risk and vulnerability, and respond to climate changes.

In order to prevent heat-related illness, it is recommended that workers take breaks during working hours. However, this would lead to reductions in worktime and labor productivity. In this study, we estimate the economic cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks associated with climate change under a wide range of climatic and socioeconomic conditions. We calculate the worktime reduction based on the recommendation of work/rest ratio and the estimated future wet bulb glove temperature, which is an index of heat stresses. Corresponding GDP losses (cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks) are estimated using a computable general equilibrium model throughout this century. Under the highest emission scenario, GDP losses in 2100 will range from 2.6 to 4.0% compared to the current climate conditions. On the other hand, GDP losses will be less than 0.5% if the 2.0 °C goal is achieved. The benefit of climate-change mitigation for avoiding worktime loss is comparable to the cost of mitigation (cost of the greenhouse gas emission reduction) under the 2.0 °C goal. The relationship between the cost of heat-related illness prevention through worker breaks and global average temperature rise is approximately linear, and the difference in economic loss between the 1.5 °C goal and the 2.0 °C goal is expected to be approximately 0.3% of global GDP in 2100. Although climate mitigation and socioeconomic development can limit the vulnerable regions and sectors, particularly in developing countries, outdoor work is still expected to be affected. The effectiveness of some adaptation measures such as additional installation of air conditioning devices or shifting the time of day for working are also suggested. In order to reduce the economic impacts, adaptation measures should also be implemented as well as pursing ambitious climate change mitigation targets. © 2017 The Author(s).

Despite its environmental relevance, little attention has been given to cost-effective and environmentally friendly N2O abatement methods. Here we examined, the potential of a bubble column (BCR) and an internal loop airlift (ALR) bioreactors of 2.3 L for the abatement of N2O from a nitric acid plant emission. The process was based on the biological reduction of N2O by Paracoccus denitrificans using methanol as a carbon/electron source. Two nitrogen limiting strategies were also tested for the coproduction of poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate) (PHBV) coupled with N2O reduction. High N2O removal efficiencies (REs) (≈87%) together with a low PHBV cell accumulation were observed in both bioreactors in excess of nitrogen. However, PHBV contents of 38-64% were recorded under N limiting conditions along with N2O-REs of ≈57% and ≈84% in the ALR and BCR, respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analyses showed that P. denitrificans was dominant (&gt;50%) after 6 months of experimentation.

However, the 2015 Paris 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) (COP 21)"" demonstrated that there is still much room for improvement in the role played by universities in international negotiations and decision-making on climate change. To date, few scientific meetings have provided multidisciplinary perspectives on climate change in which researchers across the natural and social sciences could come together to exchange research findings and discuss methods relating to climate change mitigation and adaption studies. As a result the published literature has also lacked a broad perspective.

Increasing human and institutional capacity to address threats posed by climate change to natural resources and livelihoods requires building capacity to generate and disseminate information and knowledge on climate change, its impacts, adaptation and mitigation through research, education and raising awareness by tertiary training institutions. Most tertiary training institutions in Africa have curricula covering basic and applied natural resources management but most of them do not include climate change. This paper presents a training curriculum and manual that was developed to fill this gap. The purpose of the paper is to provide in-depth information on how Climate Change can be integrated into the fisheries and aquaculture curricula of tertiary training institutions. It also provides students, scientists, practitioners, and policy makers with an understanding of key concepts and approaches to climate change mitigation measures, adaptation strategies, and policies. The aim is to mainstream climate change in fisheries training. The specific objectives are to facilitate introduction of climate change in fisheries training in Uganda that can be developed further and adopted by other countries in Africa and elsewhere; Equip students with scientific and technical capacity to anticipate and evaluate changes in climate and its influence, communicate information to stakeholders, design, and test adaptation strategies and mitigation measures; and Increase human resource capacity to address climate change issues through reviewing and strengthening of the national education system. The curriculum consists of seven modules covering: Major threats to natural resources; Introduction to climate change Implications of climate change on aquatic productivity processes and fisheries; Implications of climate change on aquaculture; Livelihoods, impacts, adaptation and mitigation; Aquatic ecosystem modeling in relation to climate change Principles, policies, regulations and institutions required to address impacts of climate change. The modules will be delivered through lectures, discussions, case studies and field visits. It is recommended that the curriculum and manual be incorporated into training programs of tertiary training institutions to build the capacity required to address climate change challenges particularly for fisheries in Africa. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Adaptation; Capacity building; Climate change; Fisheries resources; Livelihoods; Mitigation; Tertiary institutions; Uganda",,"Efitre, J.; Department of Zoology, Uganda; email: jefitre@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319582146; 9783319582139,,,"English","Climate Change Research at Univers.: Addressing the Mitigation and Adaptat.

However, large-scale development of LB to fulfill greenhouse gas mitigation targets would require not only land previously not used for agriculture but also existing agricultural land. This study aims to evaluate agricultural market impacts and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation effects in different land use scenarios for LB to achieve a 75% GHG reduction scenario for the EU (4.1EJ of LB biomass demand) until 2050. We simulated, in a partial equilibrium agricultural sector model ESIM, three scenarios for LB cultivation: only cropland use (“cropland”), mix of cropland and pasture (“cropland+pasture”), and only marginal land (“marginal”). Our results show that all land use scenarios for LB show positive GHG mitigation effects (40-75% compared to the fossil heat emission), but lead to increasing average agricultural commodity prices by 3-10% in the EU and 3.5 - 1.3% in the rest of the world. Employing pasture for LB reduces food price increases and results in lower GHG mitigation levels compared to the exclusive use of cropland. The use of marginal land for LB exhibits the lowest impacts on food security among all scenarios, but also under this scenario, increasing land prices affect food prices. © 2017, ETA-Florence Renewable Energies.

High organic carbon content in soil is vital as it leads to improved soil quality, increased productivity, and stable soil aggregates. In addition, with the signing of the climate agreement, there is growing interest in carbon sequestration in landscapes. This paper looks at how soil organic carbon (SOC) can be increased so that it contributes not only to the reduction of atmospheric CO2, but also translates to the increased food production, thereby enhancing food security. This synergy between climate change mitigation and enhancing food security is even more relevant for mountain landscapes of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region where there remains huge potential to increase CO2 sequestration and simultaneously address food security in the chronic food deficit villages. Soil samples were collected from seven transects each in Bajhang and Mustang and from four land use types in each transect. Samples of soils were taken from two depths in each plot: 0–15 cm and 15–30 cm below the soil surface to compare the top soil and subsoil dynamics of the soil nutrients. The lab analysis was performed to assess the soil texture, soil acidity in “power of hydrogen” (pH), and macro-nutrients reflecting soil fertility. Secondary data was used to analyze the level of food deficit in the villages. The pH value of soil from Bajhang ranged from 5.3 to 9.1. The pH value of soil ranged from 5.7 to 8.8 in Mustang. SOC contents of sampled soils from Bajhang ranged from 0.20% to 7.69% with a mean amount of 2.47% ± 0.17%. SOC contents of sampled soils from Mustang ranged from 0.51% to 8.56% with a mean amount of 2.60% ± 0.25%. By land use type, forest land had the highest carbon (C) content of 53.61 t·ha−1 in Bajhang, whereas in Mustang, agricultural land had the highest C content of 52.02 tons·ha−1. Based on these data, we can say that there is potential for increasing SOC through improved soil health and crop production holistic soil management should be practiced for higher productivity, and incorporating livestock for farmyard manure would fertilize cultivated soils, which increases soil productivity. Increasing productivity would aid in enhancing the access and availability of food in these mountain villages. © 2017 by the authors.

During this time, 2 typhoons from the Pacific area went straight across Vietnam to Northern Laos and Northern Thailand instead of the usual path to Taiwan and Japan. Subsequently, huge flooding damaged many infrastructures and overtopped flood protection dikes of many industrial estates and educational institutions in the Central Plain of Thailand such as at Hi-Tech Industrial Estate, Bang Pain Industrial Estate. Navanakom Industrial Estate and Asian Institute of Technology, to name a few. The same phenomenon also occurred in neighboring Laos PDR which caused unusually heavy rains and widespread river flooding. Consequently, riverbank erosions accompanied by slope failures occurred at Xedon River in Pakse, Southern Laos due to saturation caused by high water levels accompanied by high velocity flow of the flooded river. To evaluate the stability of these mitigation structures, finite element and limit equilibrium methods were utilized. PLAXIS 2D software was used to analyze the slope protection schemes at low and high water levels incorporating the various supporting and reinforcing materials. Moreover, the PLAXIS 2D software was also utilized to predict the vertical deformations of improved flood control dikes with increased embankment height at different cases of flood water levels. In addition, the SLIDE software was used to predict the factor of safety by using limit equilibrium method for the various riverbank erosion protection structures. Furthermore. RESSA software was utilized to evaluate the slope stability of the erosion protection structures with geosynthetic reinforcements of Xedon riverbank in Pakse combined with gabions and mattresses.

We have chosen as a case study greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction policies chosen by the city of Geneva. The methodological approach consists in analysing EIA, SEA, SA and HIA conducted on three projects in three topic areas: urban planning, heating and transportation. These projects are: a complex urbanisation plan in an urban neighbourhood in Geneva (the Gare des Eaux-Vives project), a sustainable transportation plan for a central district in Geneva (the St-Gervais transportation project) and a strategy to encourage the City’s employees to use sustainable transport for local business travel. The results show some shortcomings in the consideration of health in SEA, EIA and SA. This work highlights a narrow vision of health in SEA and EIA, limiting itself to a review of the effects of projects on the determinants of the physical environment as required by the legislation relating to these tools. EIA does not require the integration of the health dimension. As for SA, our research found that health is treated much more superficially than in HIA and primarily through the analysis of ‘health and safety’ criteria. It appears from this work that HIA is the tool which provides the most elaborate assessment, compared to SA, SEA or EIA, of the consequences for health of the GHG reduction policies chosen by the local decision-makers of a city. However, our study suggests that the HIA community should identify the situations in which HIA should be carried out and in which cases it is better to include health issues within an integrated analysis. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.","climate change mitigation; Geneva; health; prospective impact assessment tools; urban","carbon footprint; city planning; climate change; employee; environmental impact assessment; health impact assessment; heating; human; human experiment; law; neighborhood; Switzerland; travel; vision; climate change; decision making; environment; greenhouse effect; health care policy; legislation and jurisprudence; procedures; Switzerland; City Planning; Climate Change; Decision Making; Environment; Greenhouse Effect; Health Impact Assessment; Health Policy; Humans; Switzerland","Diallo, T.; Institut de Santé Globale, Chemin des Mines 9, Switzerland; email: bebs.diallo13@gmail.com",,"SAGE Publications Ltd",17579759,,,"28482734","English","Global Health Promot.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021431640

This segment includes wood-based products, which in comparison to competing materials, have a low global warming potential (GWP). Studies have been conducted since the early 1990s on this aspect and despite this, studies analysing the benefits of the furniture sub-sector are rare. This paper estimates the climate change mitigation potential associated with the use of wood in kitchen cabinet, based on an evaluation of its storage and substitution benefits in selected countries in Western Europe. Results indicate that this wood furniture segment could potentially store an average of about 15 million t C annually and avoid the additional production of about 7 million t CO2. The results presented constitute a benchmark analysis that may be useful for integrating the wooden furniture sub-sector in climate change mitigation strategies.","climate change; harvested wood products; mitigation; storage; substitution; wooden-furniture","benchmarking; climate change; environmental policy; global warming; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation; strategic approach; timber harvesting; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Western Europe",,,"Commonwealth Forestry Association",14655489,,IFREF,,"English","Int.

A complete understanding of the relationship between biodiversity and carbon storage and sequestration across spatiotemporal scales relevant for climate change mitigation needs three approaches: empirical, remote sensing and ecosystem modelling. We review individual approaches and show that biodiversity has short-term and long-term benefits across spatial scales. We argue that enhanced understanding is obtained by combining approaches and, especially, integrating approaches through using ‘boundary objects’ that can be understood and measured by all approaches, such as diversity of leaf traits of the upper canopy. This will lead to better understanding of biodiversity effects on climate change mitigation, which is crucial for making sound policy decisions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",,"biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecological modeling; empirical analysis; mitigation; policy making; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; tropical forest",,,"Elsevier B.V.",18773435,,,,"English","Curr.

Using the discrete choice experiment, the authors elicit the preferences of approximately 4098 respondents from the Czech Republic, Poland, and UK for the GHG emission reduction policies that differ in four attributes: emission reduction target, burden sharing across the EU Member States, the distribution of costs within each country, and cost. The three specific reduction targets analysed correspond to the EU 2050 Roadmap and deep decarbonization policy (80% target), the climate-energy 2014 targets (40% target), and the status quo policy (20% target); each will result in a specific emission trajectory by 2050. The results reveal stark differences between the three countries. Czechs would be on average willing to pay around EUR 13 per household per month for the 40% GHG emission reductions by 2030 or EUR 17 for 80% reductions by 2050, and the citizens of the UK are willing to pay about EUR 45. Conversely, the mean willingness to pay (WTP) of Polish households for achieving more stringent targets is not statistically different from zero. The WTP for adopting policies to reach the 40% and 80% targets are not statistically different in any of the examined countries. However, it was found that the preferences in all three countries are highly heterogeneous. In addition, an insight is provided into the preferred characteristics of the future GHG emission reduction policies. Policy relevance A detailed understanding of the acceptability of climate mitigation policies among the general public is crucial for identifying the potential for improvements in their design. This study examines the public acceptability of the EU’s future mitigation policies. The authors elicit preferences of respondents from three EU countries for three different emission trajectories and reduction targets through policy packages that include several options to share the burden among the EU Member States and to distribute the costs among citizens of each country. Preferences are analysed for each attribute and the willingness-to-pay values for several alternative policy packages are derived. The authors believe that understanding public acceptability can help support the successful implementation of climate mitigation policies. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Burden sharing; climate change mitigation policy; consumer preferences; cost distribution; discrete choice experiments; GHG emission targets","climate change; discrete choice analysis; emission control; environmental policy; European Union; greenhouse gas; mitigation; policy analysis; policy implementation; public attitude; willingness to pay; Czech Republic; Poland [Central Europe]; United Kingdom","Ščasný, M.; Environment Center, Czech Republic; email: milan.scasny@czp.cuni.cz",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

We find that competitive agricultural contracts in the seed-corn industry impose significant structural barriers to adopting climate change mitigation behaviors. Seed-corn contracts constrain adoption of those behaviors through competitive rankings based solely on net commodity production and by limiting farmers’ access to information to make judicious management decisions. At the micro level, our findings suggest that informational influence—that is, where farmers turn for trusted information—also affects climate change mitigation behaviors, and that these informational networks are embedded within structural constraints. Our findings suggest that agricultural contracts serve as a significant structural constraint on the adoption of mitigation practices and that climate scholarship and policy must address both macro and micro dimensions simultaneously to encourage adoption of climate change mitigation. © 2016, by the Rural Sociological Society",,"agricultural production; climate change; contract farming; maize; seed; social impact; Michigan; United States; Zea mays",,,"Rural Sociological Society",00360112,,,,"English","Rural Sociol.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84992458091

However, there is a growing awareness that ultimate success depends upon involving subnational government, particularly cities, which are uniquely placed to address climate change in terms of both policy development and implementation of mitigation actions. In recent years the theory of multi-level governance has been used to analyse governments' roles as effective climate actors. This article uses this theory to examine legal and policy developments in New Zealand that have a direct influence on the ability of local government to contribute to climate change mitigation. New Zealand's former leadership in this area has been progressively eroded since 2004. As a result, local government is left with limited direct capacity to contribute to mitigation. Given the failure of New Zealand's national mitigation policies, the disempowerment of local government is an additional impediment to achieving emission reductions. While New Zealand may not be unique in its current lack of support for local government (and their communities), what is novel is the co-ordinated and deliberate trend away from multi-level governance. Policy relevance There is a growing awareness of the interdependence between international climate change obligations, national commitments and the role of sub-national government, cities in particular. States are being encouraged to empower subnational government to take a complementary role in climate change mitigation policy and action. This article demonstrates that the paradoxical trend in New Zealand is part of a co-ordinated policy approach favouring increased centralization and economic development over a commitment to sustainability. This deliberate disempowerment of local government leaves its most populous city with an aspirational action plan it will find difficult to deliver on. It also compounds New Zealand's current failure to undertake strong climate change mitigation action. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change mitigation; climate policy and law; Multi-level governance; subnational government; sustainability","action plan; climate change; environmental legislation; governance approach; local government; mitigation; negotiation process; policy development; policy implementation; New Zealand","Taylor, P.; School of Architecture and Planning, 26 Symonds Street, New Zealand; email: prue.taylor@auckland.ac.nz",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

While there is a diplomatic history leading to this arrangement, we argue the GCF’s allocation strategy requires further refinement if it is to adequately address climate change. We advocate prioritizing climate mitigation over adaptation in funding while not ignoring climate justice concerns all together.We recommend a more targeted approach to its funding allocations based upon the GHGs abatement potential for mitigation or climate vulnerability for adaptation of very specific non-Annex I countries.

Two literature searches were conducted on: (1) active transport health co-benefits, and (2) dietary health co-benefits. Articles needed to quantify both greenhouse gas emissions and health or nutrition outcomes resulting from active transport or diet changes. A data extraction tool (PRISMA) was created for article selection and evaluation. A rubric was devised to assess the biases, limitations and uncertainties of included articles. For active transport 790 articles were retrieved, nine meeting the inclusion criteria. For diet 2524 articles were retrieved, 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 articles were reviewed and assessed using the rubric, as one article met the inclusion criteria for both active transport and diet co-benefits. Methods used to estimate the effect of diet or active transport modification vary greatly precluding meta-analysis. The scale of impact on health and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled, versus the modelling technique. Effective mitigation policies, infrastructure that supports active transport and low GHGE food delivery, plus community engagement are integral in achieving optimal health and GHGE outcomes. Variation in culture, nutritional and health status, plus geographic density will determine which mitigation scenario(s) best suit individual communities. © 2017 by the authors.

However, the role of animal mobility as a possible mitigating strategy in response to climate change has not been clearly documented. To understand this role, we investigated (i) the major methodological challenges linked to the diversity of grazing areas and other forage resources exploited by these systems and enteric emissions of methane; (ii) the impacts of grazing practices (carbon sequestration/emission) on soil and biomass carbon fluxes. We developed an approach based on two existing models (OSTRAL: Outil de Simulation du TRoupeau ovin ALlaitant and CASA: Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach) that we adapted and used in combination. This approach was applied to three French Mediterranean sheep and crop farming systems with different degrees of flock mobility (sedentary, single transhumance and double transhumance). The preliminary results produced by the whole farm model OSTRAL showed that two systems (sedentary and double transhumance) causing low carbon emissions. In the sedentary system, higher animal productivity offsets the increase in GHG emissions (in CO2eq) caused by feed production. In the pastoral system, grazing reduced total GHG emissions (in CO2eq). The CASA model proved to be useful to simulate the carbon balance under dynamic land cover in natural environments, whether used for grazing or not. This model can help assess the impact of grazing practices and carbon fluxes in systems linked to natural environments. The results of the first application showed that seasonal mobility of livestock increases the contribution of rangeland to feeding systems and improves the non-renewable energy balance of the system. It is thus extremely important to include the specificities of animals grazing in rangelands outside the structural limits of the farm when evaluating GHG emissions. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","GHG; Grazing practices; Mitigation; Mobility; Pastoral farming systems","adaptive management; biomass; carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; energy balance; forage; grazing; greenhouse gas; land cover; livestock farming; methane; mobility; pastoralism; sheep; France; Mediterranean Region; Animalia; Ovis aries","Vigan, A.; CIRAD-UMR SELMET, TA C/112 Campus de Baillarguet, France; email: vigan.aurore@laposte.net",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678809,,AEEND,,"English","Agric.

Given the immediacy of the need for global access to effective emission cutting technologies, the role of patents requires further consideration in the general climate change mitigation discourse. This paper aims to address this issue, presenting arguments on the role of the patent system from general intellectual property literature, as well as insights from specialized technological fields. The authors find that although patents provide a strong economic incentive for innovation, they limit the further commercialization of mitigation technologies based on previously patented materials and thus hinder global access to mitigation solutions. Development of mitigation technologies, specifically of renewable energies and carbon capture storage, requires predominantly an improvement of existing technologies. Therefore, patents are seen to restrict development and are perceived as an obstacle to climate change mitigation. In order to achieve the targets set by COP21, the transfer of patented technologies is a necessity. However, patents are found to act as one factor that can severely restrict the dissemination of technologies globally. Given these findings, the merits of open-source/copy-left systems of intellectual property deserve further study, especially with regard to their applicability to climate change mitigation solutions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture storage; Climate change mitigation; Patents; Renewable energy; Technology transfer",,"Raiser, K.; Institute for Advanced Sustainability Study, Berliner Str. 130, DE, Germany; email: kilian.raiser@googlemail.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",22146296,,,,"English","Energy Res.

The challenge then lies in sustaining cooperative mitigation against the temptation to free-ride on others' contributions, which can undermine public endeavours. When all possible future scenarios entail costs, however, the rationale for contributing to a public good changes from altruistic sacrifice of personal profit to necessary investment in minimizing personal debt. Here we demonstrate analytically how an economic framework of costly adaptation to climate change can sustain cooperative mitigation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. We develop game-theoretic scenarios from existing examples of insurance for adaptation to natural hazards exacerbated by climate-change that bring the debt burden from future climate events into the present. We model the as-yet untried potential for leveraging public contributions to mitigation from personal costs of adaptation insurance, by discounting the insurance premium in proportion to progress towards a mitigation target. We show that collective mitigation targets are feasible for individuals as well as nations, provided that the premium for adaptation insurance in the event of no mitigation is at least four times larger than the mitigation target per player. This prediction is robust to players having unequal vulnerabilities, wealth, and abilities to pay. We enumerate the effects of these inequalities on payoffs to players under various sub-optimal conditions. We conclude that progress in mitigation is hindered by its current association with a social dilemma, which disappears upon confronting the bleak consequences of inaction. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Collective risk; Game theory; Natural disasters; Public goods; Risk reduction","adaptive management; climate change; collective action; emission control; environmental economics; game theory; greenhouse gas; insurance system; mitigation; natural disaster; public goods; risk assessment; trade-environment relations; willingness to pay","Doncaster, C.P.; Biological Sciences B85, United Kingdom; email: cpd@soton.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",09218009,,ECECE,,"English","Ecol.

Yet, under conditions of climate warming, little is known regarding the ability of small-scale dairy producers to maintain production and/or the robustness of possible adaptation options in meeting the challenges presented, particularly heat stress. The authors created a simple, deterministic model to explore the influence of breed and heat stress relief options on smallholder dairy farmers in Odisha, India. Breeds included indigenous Indian (non-descript), low-grade Jersey crossbreed and high-grade Jersey crossbreed. Relief strategies included providing shade, fanning and bathing. The impact of predicted critical global climate parameters, a 2°C and 4°C temperature rise were explored. A feed price scenario was modelled to illustrate the importance of feed in impact estimation. Feed costs were increased by 10% to 30%. Across the simulations, high-grade Jersey crossbreeds maintained higher milk yields, despite being the most sensitive to the negative effects of temperature. Low-capital relief strategies were the most effective at reducing heat stress impacts on household income. However, as feed costs increased the lower-grade Jersey crossbreed became the most profitable breed. The high-grade Jersey crossbreed was only marginally (4.64%) more profitable than the indigenous breed. The results demonstrate the importance of understanding the factors and practical trade-offs that underpin adaptation. The model also highlights the need for hot-climate dairying projects and programmes to consider animal genetic resources alongside environmentally sustainable adaptation measures for greatest poverty impact. ©The Animal Consortium 2016.","Animal genetic resources; Climate change; Cow; India; Temperature-humidity index","adverse effects; animal; animal food; animal husbandry; bovine; breeding; climate change; economics; genetics; heat; India; milk; physiology; procedures; secretion (process); theoretical model; Animal Feed; Animal Husbandry; Animals; Breeding; Cattle; Climate Change; Hot Temperature; India; Milk; Models, Theoretical",,,"Cambridge University Press",17517311,,,"28027721","English","Animal",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007505071

Key recurring principles in this debate are capacity and historical responsibility. To keep global warming within the internationally agreed 2 °C limit, many countries will have to engage in more ambitious climate policies relative to current INDCs. Public support will be crucial in this respect. We thus explore the implications of different fairness principles for citizens’ preferences concerning burden sharing in climate policy. To this end, we implemented an online experiment in which participants (N = 414) played an ultimatum game. Participants were tasked with sharing the costs of climate change mitigation. The aim was to examine how participants’ willingness to pay for mitigation was influenced by capacity and historical responsibility considerations. The results show that fairness principles do have a strong effect and that participants applied fairness principles differently depending on their position at the outset. It turns out that participants paid more attention to other players’ capacity and historical responsibility when proposing a particular cost allocation and more attention to their own capacity and responsibility when responding to proposals by others. These and other findings suggest that framing climate policy in terms of internationally coordinated unilateral measures is likely to garner more public support than framing climate policy in terms of a global bargaining effort over the mitigation burden. © Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht 2017.",,"Global warming; Climate change mitigation; Cost allocation; Global climates; Multilateral negotiations; On-line experiments; Public support; Ultimatum game; Willingness to pay; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; experimental study; global climate; global warming; international agreement; Internet; willingness to pay","Anderson, B.; Center for Comparative and International Studies (CIS), Haldeneggsteig 4, Switzerland; email: brile.anderson@ir.gess.ethz.ch",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Seaweed farms release carbon that maybe buried in sediments or exported to the deep sea, therefore acting as a CO2 sink. The crop can also be used, in total or in part, for biofuel production, with a potential CO2 mitigation capacity, in terms of avoided emissions from fossil fuels, of about 1,500 tons CO2 km-2 year-1. Seaweed aquaculture can also help reduce the emissions from agriculture, by improving soil quality substituting synthetic fertilizer and when included in cattle fed, lowering methane emissions from cattle. Seaweed aquaculture contributes to climate change adaptation by damping wave energy and protecting shorelines, and by elevating pH and supplying oxygen to the waters, thereby locally reducing the effects of ocean acidification and de-oxygenation. The scope to expand seaweed aquaculture is, however, limited by the availability of suitable areas and competition for suitable areas with other uses, engineering systems capable of coping with rough conditions offshore, and increasing market demand for seaweed products, among other factors. Despite these limitations, seaweed farming practices can be optimized to maximize climate benefits, which may, if economically compensated, improve the income of seaweed farmers. © 2017 Duarte, Wu, Xiao, Bruhn and Krause-Jensen.","Aquaculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Macroalgae; Seaweed; Sequestration",,"Duarte, C.M.; Red Sea Research Center, Saudi Arabia; email: carlos.duarte@kaust.edu.sa",,"Frontiers Media S.

Enhanced weathering (EW) in agricultural soils-applying crushed silicate rock as a soil amendment-is a method for combating global climate change while increasing nutrient availability to plants. EW uses land that is already producing food and fuel to sequester carbon (C), and reduces N2O loss through pH buffering. As biofuel use increases, EW in bioenergy crops offers the opportunity to sequester CO2 while reducing fossil fuel combustion. Uncertainties remain in the long-term effects and global implications of large-scale efforts to directly manipulate Earth's atmospheric CO2 composition, but EW in agricultural lands is an opportunity to employ these soils to sequester atmospheric C while benefitting crop production and the global climate. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

We review the potential for deployment of enhanced weathering (EW), via the application of crushed reactive silicate rocks (such as basalt), on over 680 million hectares of tropical agricultural and tree plantations to offset fossil fuel CO2 emissions. Warm tropical climates and productive crops will substantially enhance weathering rates, with potential co-benefits including decreased soil acidification and increased phosphorus supply promoting higher crop yields sparing forest for conservation, and reduced cultural eutrophication. Potential pitfalls include the impacts of mining operations on deforestation, producing the energy to crush and transport silicates and the erosion of silicates into rivers and coral reefs that increases inorganic turbidity, sedimentation and pH, with unknown impacts for biodiversity. We identify nine priority research areas for untapping the potential of EW in the tropics, including effectiveness of tropical agriculture at EW for major crops in relation to particle sizes and soil types, impacts on human health, and effects on farmland, adjacent forest and stream-water biodiversity. © 2017 The Author(s) Published by the Royal Society.

While efforts to mitigate climate change involve energy mix, energy efficiency and cleaner technology, financial development has also been considered as an important factor. Indicator of financial development may draw FDI and advanced degree of research and development which can accelerate economic growth and hence affect dynamism of environmental performance. This study examines the impacts of energy use and financial development indicators by source in the environment-growth-energy model for 90 countries categorized on the basis of income possession over the period 1980–2014. The study applies the panel analysis that accounts for cross-sectional dependence and heterogeneity of series used in the estimation. Results from panel Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS) show that in all the categories of countries, fossil fuel energy use and GDP per capita are found to be the major drivers of CO2emissions though fossil fuel energy use possesses the bigger elasticities. Population however, displays a sign contrary to expectation regarding economic theory in high income countries. Renewable energy and financial development on the other hand are capable of reducing CO2emissions. However, the magnitude of the long-run elasticity of CO2emissions with respect to renewable energy use and financial development are much greater in the models with M2/GDP than the model with M2/Reserve especially in the high income countries. Policies should be geared towards stimulating investments in renewable energy technology. There is need to develop robust financial systems to lend financial credence to research institutes to work towards producing energy that have less carbon or are carbon-free. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy use; Financial development; Global perspective; Mitigation process","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economics; Elasticity; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Finance; Fossil fuels; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Cross sectional dependence; Energy use; Environmental performance; Financial development; Global perspective; Renewable energy technologies; Research and development; Climate change","Yang Shu; School of Economics, China",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

To date, energy efficiency improvement (EEI) has been broadly introduced exogenously in integrated assessment models (IAMs) by virtue of the autonomous energy efficiency improvement (AEEI) coefficient; however, it is usually good at capturing the EEI driven by non-price factors, while weak in describing the EEI induced by policy incentives. In this paper, we introduce an endogenous EEI (EEEI) mechanism in an IAM, called E3METL, to explore the impacts of EEEI on the global macro-economy, CO2 emission paths, and timing of carbon mitigations. The results reveal that (1) introducing EEEI significantly improves gross world product (GWP) gains, and this positive effect is partly offset when carbon restriction policies are implemented; (2) R&amp;D investment dedicated to enhance energy efficiency limits R&amp;D expenditures for other alternative technologies, and this effect will impede the development of non-fossil technologies; (3) EEEI may perform as one of supporting factors to delay the actions of carbon reduction; moreover, the introduction of EEEI lowers the optimal carbon tax level by 7.8 % on average, as compared to the no EEEI case. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","CO2 mitigation; Crowding-out effect; Endogenous energy efficiency; Integrated assessment model","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Economics; Efficiency; Investments; Alternative technologies; Crowding out; Emissions mitigation; Energy efficiency improvements; Global climate changes; Integrated assessment models; Restriction policy; Supporting factors; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; environmental economics; global climate; integrated approach; modeling; pollution tax","Duan, H.; School of Economics and Management, China; email: hbduan@ucas.ac.cn",,"Springer Netherlands",1570646X,,,,"English","Energy Effic.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84983002212

We compare the use of harvest residues for local heat and electricity production relative to a base case scenario and estimate the climate change mitigation potential at the forest management unit level. Results demonstrate large differences between and within provinces and territories across Canada. We identify regions with increasing benefits to the atmosphere for many decades into the future and regions where no net benefit would occur over the 33-year study horizon. The cumulative mitigation potential for regions with positive mitigation was predicted to be 429 Tg CO2e in 2050, with 7.1 TgC yr −1 of harvest residues producing bioenergy that met 3.1% of the heat demand and 2.9% of the electricity demand for 32.1 million people living within these regions. Our results show that regions with positive mitigation produced bioenergy, mainly from combined heat and power facilities, with emissions intensities that ranged from roughly 90 to 500 kg CO2e MWh−1. Roughly 40% of the total captured harvest residue was associated with regions that were predicted to have a negative cumulative mitigation potential in 2050 of −152 Tg CO2e. We conclude that the capture of harvest residues to produce local bioenergy can reduce GHG emissions in populated regions where bioenergy, mainly from combined heat and power facilities, offsets fossil fuel sources (fuel oil, coal and petcoke, and natural gas). © 2016 The Authors.

The core study relies on an ensemble of climate simulations under two emissions scenarios: a business-as-usual reference scenario (REF) analogous to the IPCC RCP8.5 scenario, and a greenhouse gas mitigation scenario, called POL3.7, which is in between the IPCC RCP2.6 and RCP4.5 scenarios, and is consistent with a 2 °C global mean warming from pre-industrial by 2100. Evaluating the outcomes of both climate change scenarios in the MC2 model shows that the carbon stocks of most forests around the world increased, with the greatest gains in tropical forest regions. Temperate forest regions are projected to see strong increases in productivity offset by carbon loss to fire. The greatest cost of mitigation in terms of effects on forest carbon stocks are projected to be borne by regions in the southern hemisphere. We compare three sources of uncertainty in climate change impacts on the world's forests: emissions scenarios, the global system climate response (i.e. climate sensitivity), and natural variability. The role of natural variability on changes in forest carbon and net primary productivity (NPP) is small, but it is substantial for impacts of wildfire. Forest productivity under the REF scenario benefits substantially from the CO2 fertilization effect and that higher warming alone does not necessarily increase global forest carbon levels. Our analysis underlines why using an ensemble of climate simulations is necessary to derive robust estimates of the benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation. It also demonstrates that constraining estimates of climate sensitivity and advancing our understanding of CO2 fertilization effects may considerably reduce the range of projections. © 2017 IOP Publishing Ltd.","climate change; dynamic global vegetation model; forests; MC2; mitigation scenarios; uncertainty analysis; wildfire","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Ecosystems; Fires; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Climate change scenarios; forests; Greenhouse gas mitigation; mitigation scenarios; Net primary productivity; Sources of uncertainty; Vegetation model; wildfire; Climate change; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; emission; environmental modeling; forest ecosystem; global perspective; mitigation; net primary production; scenario analysis; socioeconomic conditions; tropical forest; uncertainty analysis; vegetation dynamics; wildfire","Kim, J.B.; Pacific Northwest Research Station, 3200 SW Jefferson Way, United States; email: jbkim@fs.fed.us",,"Institute of Physics Publishing",17489318,,,,"English","Environ.Res.Lett.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018513427

In this paper we present illustrative evidence on cross-country and cross-industry differences of the firm-level mitigation targets among some of the largest corporations in the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) with regard to five aspects, i.e., target adoption, target metric, target scope, target stringency, and target completion. We find that overall 25% of the firms have not set up emission targets. The EU firms are significantly more likely to use intensity targets than the US firms. The EU firms are twice as likely as the US firms to incorporate indirect emissions from the supply chain into the scope of their targets. The Energy and Materials sectors in the EU set significantly more stringent targets than their US counterparts.

Energy usage and CO2 emissions from freight have historically grown with a correlation to GDP, and there is limited evidence of near-term global decoupling of freight demand from GDP. Over the 21st century, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from freight are projected to grow faster than passenger transportation or other major end-use sectors, with the magnitude of growth dependent on the assumed extent of long-term decoupling. In climate change mitigation scenarios that apply a price to GHG emissions, mitigation of freight emissions (including the effects of demand elasticity, mode and technology shifting, and fuel substitution) is more limited than for other demand sectors. In such scenarios, shifting to less-emitting transportation modes and technologies is projected to play a relatively small role in reducing freight emissions in GCAM. By contrast, changes in the supply chain of liquid fuels that reduce the fuel carbon intensity, especially deriving from large-scale use of biofuels coupled to carbon capture and storage technologies, are responsible for the majority of freight emissions mitigation, followed by price-induced reduction in freight demand services.

The industry grew rapidly in the 1970s, as large financial conglomerates acquired independent firms. While providing needed financial support, conglomerates changed the focus from existing markets in consumer applications toward a future utility market that never materialized. Concentration of the industry also left it vulnerable to the corporate restructuring of the 1980s, when the conglomerates were dismantled and solar divisions were pared back or sold off to foreign firms. Both the move toward conglomeration, when corporations became managed as stock portfolios, and its subsequent reversal were the result of increased financial dominance over corporate governance. The American case is contrasted with the more successful case of Japan, where these changes to corporate governance did not occur. Insulated from shareholder pressure and financial turbulence, Japanese photovoltaics manufacturers continued to expand investment throughout the 1980s when their American rivals were cutting back. The study is informed by Joseph Schumpeter’s theory of creative destruction and Hyman Minsky’s theory of financialization, along with economic sociology. By highlighting the tenuous and conflicting relation between finance and production that shaped the early history of the photovoltaics industry, the article raises doubts about the prevailing approach to mitigate climate change through carbon pricing. Given the uncertainty of innovation and the ease of speculation, it will do little to spur low-carbon technology development without financial structures supporting patient capital. © 2017 The Authors, some rights reserved.",,"Commerce; Economics; Finance; Industrial management; Investments; Photovoltaic effects; Solar power generation; Climate change mitigation; Consumer applications; Corporate governance; Corporate restructuring; Creative destruction; Financial structures; Low-carbon industries; Low-carbon technologies; Climate change","Jerneck, M.; Mistra Center for Sustainable Markets (Misum), Sweden; email: max.jerneck@hhs.se",,"American Association for the Advancement of Science",23752548,,,"28435862","English","Sci.

These models are required to represent a large number of processes in different sectors, but face particular challenges in describing the individual and social behaviors that underpin climate change mitigation and adaptation. We assess descriptions of these behaviors in existing models, their commonalities and differences, and the uses to which they have been put. We find that behavioral models have a distinct and important role to play in climate research, but that they currently suffer from being strongly sectoral in nature, with agricultural models being the most common and behaviorally rich. There are also clear convergences, with economic-based decision-making remaining dominant and behaviors such as diffusion, interaction, anticipation, or learning remaining relatively neglected. Active climate change is also rarely modeled, with adaptation and mitigation generally represented as responses to economic drivers under static climatic conditions. Furthermore, dynamic behaviors, objectives, or decision-making processes are almost entirely absent, despite their clear relevance to climate change responses. We conclude that models have been more successful in the identification of important processes than in their implementation and that, while some behavioral processes may remain impossible to model, behavioral models of adaptation and mitigation in land-based sectors have substantial unexplored potential. We suggest that greater attention be paid to the cumulative coverage of models in this field, and that improvements in the representation of certain key behaviors be prioritized.

We also compared a rate-based policy with a cap-and-trade policy and found that the former leads to a greater reduction in the real GDP than the latter.

Island spatiality encourages renewable energy and sustainability initiatives that emphasise iconicity and are undertaken in order to gain competitive advantage, strengthen sustainable tourism or ecotourism, claim undue credit, distract from failures of governance or obviate the need for more comprehensive policy action. Without necessarily contributing significantly to climate change mitigation, the pursuit of eco-island status can raise costs without raising income, distract from more pressing social and environmental problems, lead to competitive sustainability and provide green cover behind which communities can maintain unsustainable practices. We argue that eco-islands do not successfully encourage wider sustainable development and climate change mitigation. Instead, island communities may place themselves in eco-island traps. Islands may invest in inefficient or ineffective renewable energy and sustainability initiatives in order to maintain illusory eco-island status for the benefit of ecotourism, thereby becoming trapped by the eco-label. Islands may also chase the diminishing returns of ever-more comprehensive and difficult to achieve sustainability, becoming trapped into serving as eco-island exemplars. We conclude by arguing that island communities should pursue locally contextualised development, potentially focused on climate change adaptation, rather than focus on an eco-island status that is oriented toward place branding and ecotourism. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers)","climate change mitigation; conspicuous sustainability; ecotourism; islands; renewable energy; sustainability","adaptive management; alternative energy; climate change; ecotourism; environmental management; renewable resource; sustainability; sustainable development",,,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00040894,,,,"English","Area",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84986331098

There are numerous problems with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) for designating national responsibilities for CO2 emissions (NRCE)–including the dispute over the equity of production-based mechanisms and vague definitions of historical emissions. Therefore, it is necessary to re-think the principles that should govern the allocation of NRCE. The essence of the dispute over production- or consumption-based emissions accounting is the distribution of the CO2 trade balance (CTB) between two partners. “Common but Differentiated Responsibilities” (CBDR) provides a foundation for discussing equity in global climate policy. Based on CBDR, this article proposes a rubric of equity principles for defining NRCE: first, there are “horizontal allocation rules”, according to which the CTB between trading partners is distributed according to their respective levels of development (as measured by the Human Development Index), emissions per capita and gains from the trade; second, there are “vertical extending rules”, according to which the historical emissions of a country are accounted for with reference to the horizontal allocation rules and added to the present-day NRCE of the country. We argue that considering global climate policy coordination in this light will contribute to formulating a more robust definition of NRCE. © 2015 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; CO2 emissions; equity; historical emissions; trade","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; conceptual framework; emissions trading; environmental policy; equity; global change; global climate; human development index; mitigation; trade-environment relations; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change","Liu, L.; School of Public Administration, No.24 South Section 1, Yihuan Road, China; email: liulei811@gmail.com",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17565529,,,,"English","Clim.

However, its production and utilization leads to undesirable carbon emissions that aggravate global warming which results in climate change. The agriculture sector is a significant user of energy. However, it has the potential to be a major contributor to Nigeria’s energy supply mix in meeting its energy deficit. More so, in the light of current and impending adverse effects of climate change, there is a need to contain GHG’s emissions. This paper focuses on bioenergy utilization as a climate change mitigation strategy and one that can, through effective waste management, enhance sustainable economic development in Nigeria. The paper employed a critical discourse analysis to examine the potential of the agricultural sector to provide biofuels from energy crops and other biomass sources. We conclude that Nigeria can reduce its GHG emissions and greatly contribute to global climate change mitigation while also alleviating its energy supply deficit if the agricultural and municipal wastes readily available in its towns and cities are converted to bioenergy. Such engagements will not only promote a clean and healthy environment but also create jobs for economic empowerment and a better standard of living for the people. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agriculture; Bioenergy; Climate change; Mitigation; Nigeria; Renewable energy","adaptive management; agriculture; bioenergy; biofuel; climate change; economic development; energy crop; energy resource; global climate; greenhouse gas; renewable resource; sustainability; waste management; Nigeria; biofuel; agriculture; biomass; climate change; crop; Nigeria; procedures; waste management; Agriculture; Biofuels; Biomass; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Nigeria; Waste Management","Elum, Z.A.; Department of Agricultural Economics and Extension, Nigeria; email: zeldaforreal@yahoo.com",,"Springer Verlag",09441344,,ESPLE,"27933500","English","Environ.

For this, our model has been extended by disaggregating the agricultural demand sector into individual agri-food demands to allow for a more in-depth analysis. Besides a business-as-usual (baseline) scenario, we have constructed four different agri-food scenarios to assess the viability of reducing Canadian meat and dairy consumption in order to diminish Canada’s agricultural sector energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Our policy scenarios progressively restrict the consumption of different meat and dairy agricultural products until the year 2030. Our results suggest that the implementation of a meat and dairy consumption reduction policy would lead to a 10 to 40 % reduction in agricultural GHG emissions, depending on the severity of the scenario. This translates to a 1 to 3 % decrease in total Canadian GHG emissions by the year 2030. Besides these environmental benefits, health benefits associated with a reduction in meat and dairy consumption (as inferred from other studies) are presented as an additional source of motivation for implementing such a policy in Canada. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Climate change; Consumer behaviour; Energy sector modelling; Food consumption patterns; Policy analysis","Agricultural products; Agricultural robots; Climate models; Consumer behavior; Energy utilization; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Meats; Agricultural sector; Business-as-usual; Climate change mitigation; Consumption reductions; Energy sector; Environmental benefits; Food consumption; Policy analysis; Climate change; agroindustry; carbon emission; climate change; consumption behavior; dairy farming; energy use; food consumption; greenhouse gas; meat; Canada","Bahn, O.; GERAD and Department of Decision Sciences, 3000 chemin de la Côte-Sainte-Catherine, Canada; email: olivier.bahn@hec.ca",,"Springer International Publishing",14202026,,,,"English","Environ.

The growing global population is putting pressure on agricultural production systems that aim to secure food production while minimising GHG emissions. In this study, the GHG emissions associated with the production of major food commodities in India are calculated using the Cool Farm Tool. GHG emissions, based on farm management for major crops (including cereals like wheat and rice, pulses, potatoes, fruits and vegetables) and livestock-based products (milk, eggs, chicken and mutton meat), are quantified and compared. Livestock and rice production were found to be the main sources of GHG emissions in Indian agriculture with a country average of 5.65 kg CO2eq kg−1 rice, 45.54 kg CO2eq kg−1 mutton meat and 2.4 kg CO2eq kg−1 milk. Production of cereals (except rice), fruits and vegetables in India emits comparatively less GHGs with &lt;1 kg CO2eq kg−1 product. These findings suggest that a shift towards dietary patterns with greater consumption of animal source foods could greatly increase GHG emissions from Indian agriculture. A range of mitigation options are available that could reduce emissions from current levels and may be compatible with increased future food production and consumption demands in India. © 2016","Agriculture; Cool Farm Tool; Greenhouse gas emissions; Indian diets; Sustainability","agricultural emission; agricultural production; artificial diet; climate change; diet; emission control; food production; greenhouse gas; livestock farming; sustainability; India; Animalia; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum","Vetter, S.H.; Institute of Biological and Environmental Sciences, United Kingdom; email: sylvia.vetter@abdn.ac.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",01678809,,AEEND,,"English","Agric.

Further changes are expected and they will have a profound effect on agriculture. Future crop production will take place against increasing CO2 levels and temperatures, decreasing water availability, and increasing frequency of extreme weather events. This review contributes to research on agricultural practices for climate change, but with a more regional perspective. The present study explores climate change impacts on UK agriculture, particularly food crop production, and how to mitigate and build resilience to climate change by adopting and/or changing soil management practices, including fertilisation and tillage systems, new crop adoption and variety choice. Some mitigation can be adopted in the shorter term, such as changes in crop type and reduction in fertiliser use, but in other cases the options will need greater investment and longer adaptation period. This is the case for new crop variety development and deployment, and possible changes to soil cultivations. Uncertainty of future weather conditions, particularly extreme weather, also affect decision-making for adoption of practices by farmers to ensure more stable and sustainable production. Even when there is real potential for climate change mitigation, it can sometimes be more difficult to accomplish with certainty on-farm. Better future climate projections and long-term investments will be required to create more resilient agricultural systems in the UK in the face of climate change challenges. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2016 Society of Chemical Industry","adaptive practices, crop production; climate change; crop husbandry; mitigation; soil management","agriculture; chemistry; climate change; crop; growth, development and aging; procedures; soil; United Kingdom; Agriculture; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Soil; United Kingdom","Rial-Lovera, K.; Royal Agricultural University, United Kingdom; email: Karen.Rial-Lovera@rau.ac.uk",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",00225142,,JSFAA,"27103504","English","J.

With a view to fast and cost-effective estimation of radical biomass, a new procedure for easy root-to-shoot calculation based on vibrational data was proposed, resulting in an excellent agreement with the values obtained from conventional direct belowground and aerial biomass measurements: 0.23 for C. ladanifer and 0.54 for E. arborea. Carbon sequestration, estimated at 45 and 73 t CO2 eq·ha−1 for C. ladanifer and E. arborea, respectively, was subsequently determined.

About half of the initiatives do not meet any of these criteria, and not even 15% satisfy three or more. Many initiatives were created only for the purpose of networking.

Especially in China, rapid, large-scale urban development alongside rapid economic growth has resulted in considerable urban climate change since the 1990s, creating urban environmental problems such as haze. Currently, most of the studies on this matter that are being conducted in China focus on the impact of urban development on urban climate change. Few studies have focused on developing solutions for microscale urban climate change. In this study, four micro-scaled districts in Xi'an were selected to represent the typical building styles that developed in different historical periods. These are a traditional residential district (1950s), a low-rise district (1980s), a mixed-rise district (1970s-2000s), and a highrise district (2010s). The urban climate was here evaluated using the urban environmental simulation system scSTREAM, and the mitigation solutions of urban typology optimizing are proposed in the discussion. The change in the urban micro-climate along with the change in urban typology were indicated, and the proposed solutions indicate in detail the impact of various solutions on different urban conditions.

However, mainly because of severe droughts in 2013 and 2014 (as a matter of fact, the droughts started in December, 2012, and are still worrying Brazilians in the first quarter of 2015), renewable and non-renewable alternative sources are expected to grow. Some of the factors expected to spur small-scale, distributed generation (DG) are costs and socio-environmental impacts of expanding the national grid, the countryâ€™s large, geographically diverse territory, and decreasing costs of renewable DG sources. Complementing the Brazilian electricity mix with renewable DG can contribute not only to climate change mitigationâ€”by avoiding new GHG emissionsâ€”but also to climate change adaptation through economic and electric diversification. Indeed, economic diversification is one of the goals on the United Nationsâ€™ Framework Convention on Climate Change (see U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change). The authors noted in a previous article the lack of information in Brazil about photovoltaic energy and the role of the university promoting this concept (see Suni, Benevides, and Guerra). Now, they intend to demonstrate, besides DGâ€™s benefits to climate change mitigation and adaptation, how stakeholdersâ€™ engagement in this field can improve the sustainability of DG and accelerate its adoption in the country. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Brazil; Climate change adaptation and mitigation; Renewable distributed generation",,"de SÃ¡ e Benevides, M.C.; University of Southern Santa CatarinaBrazil; email: mariocsb@enstt.com",,"Springer",21997373,,,,"English","World Sustain.

Silvopastoral systems are more adapted to changing climate and weather, as foliage production from trees and shrubs is less affected by such changes than grasses. Moreover, unlike conventional grass-based pastures, which contribute to green house gas emissions through land conversions and increased enteric methane production from livestock, silvopastoral systems contribute towards mitigation of green house gases though direct sequestration of atmospheric carbon and reduction of enteric methane production. Similarly trees and shrubs in silvopastoral systems contribute to general ecological integrity through improvement of soil fertility, soil and water conservation and farm and pastureland productivities. Appreciating the different benefits of silvopastoral system a lot of fodder tree species mainly Cystisus proliferus, Sesbania sesban and Leucaena leucaocephala have been introduced into the dryland livestock production systems of Ethiopia. However, such species did not bring envisaged benefits of increased livestock production and climate change adaptation, because most of these species, being exotic, failed to adapt to local socio-ecological settings. It is therefore, argued that locally adaptable species selected by local farmers, like F. thonningii explained in this paper, are more efficient in improving the productivity of livestock in drylands while at the same time increasing their capacity to adapt to recurrent drought or changing climate. Therefore, increased intervention and investment aimed at identification, promotion and implementation of indigenous species for silvopastoral system based practices is recommended for achieving climate resilience and increased productivity in the livestock sector of the dry lands. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Clean Development Mechanism; Fodder Tree; Livestock Production System; Livestock Sector; Silvopastoral System",,"Balehegn, M.; Department of Animal, Post Box 231, Ethiopia; email: mulubrhan.balehegn@mu.edu.et",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071454275

One of the most important forest ecosystem services is carbon sink from atmosphere during its early growing stage as compared to the late stage. And this has been used as a climate change adaptation strategy locally and mitigation mechanism globally to curb the multi-sectorial problems of climate change. But this depends on effective participation of the households on forest ecosystem service provision (FESP) activities. Therefore, this paper presents the socio-economic determinants of the local household participation on FESP using 157 sampled households with econometric and descriptive analysis. The result shows that FESP negatively determined by gender difference, state of agro-ecology/agro-ecosystem, level of annual net benefit, distance to forest site and other source of income while attending on community meeting and literacy level increased level of participation thereby increasing annual return of individual local households. Furthermore, the highest returns from FESP goes to the rich households and the poor earn less for their fair share of labor though highest costs covered by the rich. Therefore, all users and services providers ought to facilitate inspiring environments to gear the way forward for climate change adaptation and mitigation mechanisms in the future. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation and mitigation; Carbon sink; Climate change; Participation",,"Dawit, D.; Centre for Environment and Development, P.O.Box: 33715, Ethiopia; email: dawitdesalegn6@gmail.com",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071448692

While the Government’s green economy strategy targets the financial opportunities and sustainability co-benefits of low emissions development, the climate resilient strategy focuses on managing risk and building resilience to shocks brought about by climate change. The effectiveness of these national policy processes in directing the delivery of climate finance are assessed through the use of a principles, criteria and indicators (PCI) analytical framework. The four principles of policy development considered relevant to the effective delivery of climate change finance are ease of implementation, legitimacy, coherence and transparency. The analyses of effectiveness suggest the main policy instrument, the CRGE strategy, has been well designed for ease of implementation, with coherence across the two main elements of the strategy (mitigation and adaptation). The mitigation (or green economy) element began earlier and has been influential in informing the overall growth trajectory that aims to secure for Ethiopia middle income status by 2025 in a carbon neutral way. The more recent adaptation (or climate resilience) part of the strategy has now been prepared for the agriculture, forestry, water and energy sectors. This demonstrates effective sector prioritisation so as to secure the livelihoods of those most vulnerable to climate change. Two areas are identified where further effectiveness gains may be sought for enhancing adaptation. The first concerns securing the active participation of all stakeholders in the policy process so as to maximise the likelihood of implementation of climate change programmes and projects. Second, the present policy is silent on how it will promote transparency in climate finance delivery, which is a generally-held principle of public administration. Creating additional space for non-government actors (including micro and small business entrepreneurs and community leaders) to participate in policy influencing platforms and developing and subsequently publishing performance-based measures for the allocation of climate finance are recommended for more effective implementation of Ethiopia’s CRGE climate policy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Climate policy; Coherence; Ease of implementation; Legitimacy; Transparency",,"Simane, B.; College of Development Studies, Ethiopia; email: simaneb@yahoo.com",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071417722

Currently, critical rare metals are highly demanded and growing fast in green technologies. Recycling of mineral waste sources for the recovery of critical rare metals are one of the alternative resource for this critical rare metals crisis. Various mineral waste sources such as mine residues and coal ash are rich sources of rare earth elements.

Worldwide, in the actual context of climate changes, more frequent and powerful natural disasters are expected. Disasters, representing a direct consequence of climate change, have also a negative impact on the environment as they are an obstacle to achieve sustainable development. In particular, Romania has many areas with different environmental problems concerning: air quality, water quality, soil quality, forest health, accidental pollution caused by the chemical industry, thermal processes or oil refineries. They represent a serious threat to the environment and implicitly for the population. Romania has endured the most sizeable and rapid urban change during the last decade. At the same time, this is a territory of substantial importance due to its significant natural and economic resources, as well as to its sensitivity with respect to unfavourable ecological impacts. Some of urban areas have undergone a considerable change in the past ten years. Therefore, urban dynamics monitoring of Romania appears to be an essential factor to the integrated urban areas management. So, scientists are urged to develop urban environment models in order to understand the mechanism of environmental issues better. With the study on these mechanisms of environmental issues, we can make a better urban environmental planning to achieve the best urban environmental benefits. The level of the living environment of humans, animals and plants is rising as a result of the improvement of the ecological environment. This is not only beneficial to human health but also to the protection of endangered plant and animal species. The study has great significance to both human and nature. The aim of this paper involves urban green spaces monitoring with a view to inventorying urban wooded areas and the trees inside the cities using LiDAR technology. As study area, a park near the “Dan Păltinișanu” stadium, Timișoara, Romania was chosen. The measurements have been realized using Trimble MX2, a mobile laser scanning system that combines high resolution laser scanning and precise positioning to collect georeferenced point cloud that is useful to projects with vast requirements. The platform used for data collection is composed of a Ford vehicle on which the Trimble MX2 scanner has been mounted. There were two sets of data collected at different speeds of approximately 10km/h, respectively 30km/h. For data processing, corrections are needed either given by a reference station either by a permanent GNSS station. In the second case, the correction are ordered and paid according to the number of hours requested to the Cadastre and Land Registration Office. For the present study, corrections from our own reference station have been used. © SGEM2017 All Rights Reserved.","Climate change mitigation; LiDAR; Mobile scanning; Urban green space monitoring; Vegetation index","Air quality; Animals; Chemical industry; Conservation; Data handling; Disasters; Environmental protection; Laser applications; Laws and legislation; Optical radar; Scanning; Sustainable development; Thermal pollution; Urban planning; Water pollution; Water quality; Climate change mitigation; Ecological environments; Environmental planning; Impact on the environment; Laser scanning systems; Urban environment model; Urban green spaces; Vegetation index; Climate change",,,"International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference",13142704,9786197408263,,,"English","Int.

For example, a number of decision-support tools on transport planning provide information on expected effects of different measures (actions, policies, or interventions) on air quality, often combined with information on noise pollution or mitigation costs. These tools range in complexity and scale of applicability, from city to international, and include one or several polluting sectors. However, evaluation of the need and utility of tools to support decisions on such linked issues is often lacking, especially for tools intended to support local authorities at the city scale. Here we assessed the need for and value of combining air pollution and climate change mitigation measures into one decision-support tool and the existing policy context in which such a tool might be used. We developed a prototype decision-support tool for evaluating measures for coordinated management of air quality and climate change; and administered a survey in which respondents used the prototype to answer questions about demand for such tools and requirements to make them useful. Additionally, the survey asked questions about participants’ awareness of linkages between air pollution and climate change that are crucial for considering synergies and tradeoffs among mitigation measures. Participants showed a high understanding of the linkages between air pollution and climate change, especially recognizing that emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants come from the same source. Survey participants were: European, predominantly German; employed across a range of governmental, non-governmental and research organizations; and responsible for a diversity of issues, primarily involving climate change, air pollution or environment. Survey results showed a lack of awareness of decision-support tools and little implementation or regular use. However, respondents expressed a general need for such tools while also recognizing barriers to their implementation, such as limited legal support or lack of time, finances, or manpower. The main barrier identified through this study is the mismatch between detailed information needed from such tools to make them useful at the local implementation scale and the coarser scale information readily available for developing such tools. Significant research efforts at the local scale would be needed to populate decision-support tools with salient mitigation alternatives at the location of implementation. Although global- or regional-scale information can motivate local action towards sustainability, effective on-the-ground implementation of coordinated measures requires knowledge of local circumstances and impacts, calling for active engagement of the local research communities. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air quality; Climate change; Decision-support; Decision-support tools; Policy; Urban","air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; cost analysis; decision support system; environmental issue; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; local participation; perception; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; survey method; trade-off; urban planning; Germany","Von Schneidemesser, E.; Institute for Advanced Sustainability StudiesGermany; email: evs@iass-potsdam.de",,"University of California Press",23251026,,,,"English","Elementa",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061809550

Therefore there is a growing need in various research fields including protected horticulture industry to record and process data from multiple sensors, sensors sometimes located in remote greenhouses, miles apart from each other. The usual approach to sensor data recording implies separate measurement equipment for each variable, making difficult and expensive the integration and processing of joint data. In this paper an affordable solution is here proposed, providing with an integrated multivariable measurement environment, using commercial-off-the shelf (COTS) and taking advantage of the ubiquitous computing capabilities available today, in what is generally known as Internet of Things. The proposed system was successfully tested as a monitor to measure drainage (milliliters) and electrical conductivity (mS/cm) on cucumber crops. Multiple variables (drainage, electrical conductivity, as inputs and irrigation as output) are associated as linguistic variables for decision-making considering a Mandani Fuzzy Logic Controller. Furthermore, captured data is sent to a remote database that is connected to Internet, where researchers can perform various data analysis online for monitoring and decision-making towards mitigation of climate change effects on sensible tropical crops. © Copyright (2017) by International Astronautical Federation All rights reserved.","COTS components; Decision-making; Fuzzy Logic Controller; Internet of Things; Irrigation scheduling","Computer circuits; Controllers; Crops; Data handling; Decision making; Electric conductivity; Fuzzy logic; Internet of things; Irrigation; Multivariable systems; Software packages; Tropics; Ubiquitous computing; Commercial off-the shelves; COTS component; Electrical conductivity; Fuzzy logic controllers; Internet of Things (IOT); Irrigation scheduling; Measurement equipment; Multivariable measurements; Climate change","Carrasquilla-Batista, A.; Mechatronics Engineering Department, Costa Rica; email: acarrasquilla@itcr.ac.cr",,"International Astronautical Federation, IAF",00741795,9781510855373,,,"English","Proc.

There is now a growing need for multi-disciplinary research and for the science of climate change to be usefully translated for policy-makers.Until very recently, scientific and policy emphasis on climate change has focused almost exclusively on mitigation efforts: mechanisms and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The success of such efforts to date is debatable. In fact, the impact of ever more stringent emission control programmes could potentially have enormous social consequences. Little effort has been expended on the exploration of a systematic evaluation of climate stabilization benefits or the costs of adapting to a changed climate, let alone attempting to integrate different approaches. There is an increasing recognition that the key actors in the climate crisis also need to be preparing for change that is unavoidable. This has resulted in a greater consideration of vulnerability and adaptation.The book, based on the research programme “Vulnerability, Adaptation and Mitigation” (VAM) which ran from 2004 to 2010, funded by the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO), presents a cluster of case studies of industries, communities and institutions which each show how vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation analyses can be integrated using social behavioural sciences. Each chapter makes specific recommendations for the studied industry sector, community or institution, analyses the latest research developments of the field and identifies priorities for future research. The book argues that the inherent complexity of climate change will ultimately require a much more integrated response both scientifically - to better understand multiple causes and impacts - as well as at the scientific/policy interface, where new forms of engagement between scientists, policy-makers and wider stakeholder groups can make a valuable contribution to more informed climate policy and practice.The book is particularly timely as the scientific research and policy debate is shifting from one of problem-framing to new agendas that are much more concerned with implementation, the improvement of assessment methodologies from a multi-disciplinary perspective, and the reframing of current scientific understanding towards mitigation, adaptation and vulnerability. A critical element in responding to the climate change challenge will be to ensure the translation of these new scientific insights into innovative policy and practice “on the ground”. This book provides some fundamental elements to answer this need.The Social and Behavioural Aspects of Climate Change: Linking Vulnerability, Adaptation and Mitigation will be essential reading for social science researchers and policy managers in the area of climate change, as well as for those who want to know what the social and behavioural sciences can contribute toward coping with climate hazards. NGOs, law firms and businesses in the energy sector or other climate related fields will also find the book of great value. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351278751; 9781906093426,,,"English","The Soc. and Behavioural Aspects of Climate Change: Link.

In the brochure that accompanied the call in 2004, the programme committee hinted at the political connections between these themes: ‘Until recently, social scientific climate research was dominated by the strategy of mitigation, in the wide sense, and in particular the analysis of reduction measures. Yet at COP8-the eighth session of the “Conference of the Parties” in the “United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change” (UNFCCC) [in 2002]-the developing countries were strongly in favour of adaptation. The two subjects are most likely to be pitted against each other in future negotiations.’ This was indeed the case at the following COP sessions, including the one in Copenhagen in December 2009. The emphasis of the developing countries on adaptation is likely to be related to their perceived vulnerability: the extent to which health, economy, and nature and biodiversity will be affected as a result of a certain climatic change. The developing countries are generally considered to be more vulnerable than the industrialised nations. © 2010 Taylor & Francis.",,,,,"Taylor and Francis",,9781351278751; 9781906093426,,,"English","The Soc. and Behavioural Aspects of Climate Change: Link.

In reality, climate and energy systems contain tipping points, feedback loops, and exponential developments. This paper describes how to create realistic energy transition management models: quantitative models that can discover profitable pathways from fossil fuels to renewable energy. We review the literature regarding agent-based economics, disruptive innovation, and transition management and determine the following requirements. Actors must be detailed, heterogeneous, interacting, learning, and strategizing. Technology should be represented as a detailed and heterogeneous portfolio that can develop in a bottom-up manner, using endogenous feedback loops. Assumptions about discount rates and the social cost of carbon should be configurable. The model should contain interactions between the global, national, local, and individual level. A review of modelling techniques shows that equilibrium models are unsuitable and that system dynamics and discrete event simulation are too limited. The agent-based approach is found to be uniquely suited for the complex adaptive sociotechnical systems that must be modelled. But the choice for agent-based models does not mean a rejection of other approaches because they can be accommodated within the agent-based framework.

This duality has important implications for forest management in terms of requirements for enhanced and integrated adaptation and mitigation interventions. Two ideal conceptual level changes could provide the means for implementation. First, the incorporation of climate change considerations into definitions of sustainable forest management (SFM) would provide mandates for enhanced approaches. Second, the mainstreaming of enhanced SFM would facilitate implementation. There are, however, factors that may impede implementation. Identifying and evaluating these factors informs our understanding of requirements for adaptation and mitigation mainstreaming. This study reviews, organizes, and interprets the literature for the purposes of identifying and evaluating potential impediments. Harmonization barriers pertain to differences between adaptation and mitigation in preexisting frames and beliefs. Enabling barriers are psychological and institutional in nature. Implementation barriers include capacity deficits (e.g., funding limits, science and knowledge deficits regarding benefits, trade-offs, and synergies between adaptation and mitigation) and governance issues. Barriers are interrelated, dynamic, and subjective. Addressing barriers requires a holistic approach that recognizes the complex and dynamic nature of forest management policy change processes. © Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada 2017.","Adaptation and mitigation integration; Climate change; Mainstreaming barriers; Sustainable forest management","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Climate change adaptation; Conceptual levels; Forest management policies; Holistic approach; Implementation barriers; Mainstreaming barriers; Potential impediments; Sustainable forest management; Climate change; adaptive management; carbon cycle; climate change; forest management; governance approach; holistic approach; policy implementation; sustainable forestry; Climates; Forest Management; Canada","Williamson, T.B.; Natural Resources Canada, 5320–122 St, Canada; email: twilliam@nrcan.gc.ca",,"Canadian Science Publishing",00455067,,CJFRA,,"English","Can.

This survey represents the first large effort by ISO to systematically seek external input in mapping policy and standardization needs in EE and RE markets. The survey identified eight key findings, most notably a disconnect between policy makers and standards developers as a potential barrier to developing effective and relevant standards. Specific steps are described to support greater engagement of policy makers during the early stages of standards development and improve standard making outcomes. Greater dialogue and better coordination is needed among standards, as well as between standards and related policies in order to achieve this potential and to make positive contributions to the broader goals of policy cohesion. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy access; Energy efficiency; Energy management; International standards; Policy cohesion; Policy making; Renewable energy","Adhesion; Commerce; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy management; International cooperation; Renewable energy resources; Standardization; Standards; Surveys; Energy access; Global climate changes; International organization for standardizations; International standards; Policy making; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Standards development; Climate change; alternative energy; climate change; energy efficiency; global climate; international cooperation; international law; policy making; standard (regulation); standardization","McKane, A.; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Road, United States; email: atmckane@manage4energy.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030529276

This contribution, however, is omitted in most national and regional carbon stock estimates, and related literature in the global south is - at best - fragmentary. Therefore, this paper quantifies and maps the distribution of UGS above and below-ground carbon pools in Kumasi, Ghana. Vegetation carbon stocks were estimated using allometric equations for trees and destructive sampling for crops and other herbaceous plants. Soil organic carbon (SOC) was determined to a depth of 60 cm. Satellite imagery and GIS were used to map and extrapolate carbon stock estimates to a citywide scale. In the metropolitan area of Kumasi, a total of 3,758 Gg of carbon is stored above (vegetation) and below-ground (roots and soil). On average, 239 Mg C ha-1 is stored in trees and 81 Mg C ha-1 in the soil. Crops and herbs hold &lt;1% of the total stock. There is no correlation between SOC and tree C stocks (r=0.1073, p=0.2982). Vegetation carbon stocks differ among UGS (p=0.0071). The highest SOC stocks are in cemeteries (111 Mg C ha-1) and home gardens (105 Mg C ha-1) while the lowest (46 Mg C ha-1) occur under natural forest relics. No significant differences were observed in soils under all other UGS types. SOC stock dynamics within and between depths differ among UGS types (p&lt;0.0001).

This change probably means a shift in thermal demand, from a predominant demand for heating to a higher demand for cooling in many climates. For instance, in cold climates global warming seems to be a self-decreasing phenomenon because of lower energy demand in warmer environments. In warmer climates, like the Mediterranean, and in the hottest climates (both humid and arid), global warming must be regarded as one of the main factors (the others are the change in comfort standards and the heat-island effect) in increasing the energy demand to cool buildings. This chapter analyses the environment of various cities, characterised by mild average temperatures and small thermal oscillations, that can be regarded as Mediterranean climate emplacements. Today these cities have more heating than cooling demand but in the future will probably have higher cooling requirements. Results show that by 2050, in most of the considered emplacements, cooling demand will be higher than heating demand and emissions will rise proportionally. Solutions to this problem must be sought in the flexible operation of buildings, and policies should focus on summer-related issues: good natural ventilation, protection from the sun, and internal gain reduction, rather than insulation, air infiltration reduction and solar access. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Building sector energy policy; Climate change mitigation; Global warming; Natural cooling","Energy management; Global warming; Heating; Ventilation; Building sectors; Climate change mitigation; Cooling requirements; Environmental conditions; Mediterranean climates; Natural cooling; Natural ventilation; Thermal oscillations; Buildings","Palme, M.; School of Architecture, Chile; email: mpalme@ucn.cl",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319307466; 9783319307459,,,"English","Mediterranean Green Buildings and Renew.

When determining policy for the mitigation of climate change, there is a tendency to target production and producers. An alternative approach may be to look at consumption, and gear policy towards changing what consumers wish to purchase and consume. As India ‘develops’ in terms of a rapidly increasing GDP, it has also become the third highest emitter of Carbon Dioxide. Indians are consuming more, not only in aggregate but also on a per capita basis. Therefore, while it is well recognized that the rise in population contributes towards raising total consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, it must also be conceded that individual consumption behavior, because it impacts per capita emissions, requires the attention of policy makers. The objective of this research is to see how the quantity and composition of the average Indian’s consumption of goods and services has changed in the past two decades, and whether there are differences in consumption behavior based on rural or urban residence and on expenditure class. The changes and the differences have implications for emissions of greenhouse gases. Identifying them, therefore, helps the policy maker to locate the products as well as the consumer groups that need to be targeted. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Climate change; Consumption; Expenditure; India; Policy",,"Dutta, M.; Faculty of Social and Management Sciences, India; email: madhumatidutta@yahoo.co.in",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319456485; 9783319456461,,,"English","Environmental Change and Hum.

Mangrove carbon stocks becomes one of key parameter to study climate change and its impact to human being and environment due to its ability to sink carbon from atmosphere more than the land forest. The method of the research is conducting carbon volume analysis from backscatter coefficient of PolSARand comparing the result to carbon volume obtained from PolInSAR method. Random Volume over Ground was used to model tree biophysical aspect which established from PolInSAR method. We used two images of ALOS PALSAR dual-polarization(HH+HV) with 46 days temporal baseline. Field survey conducted to measure Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) and mangrove tree height to obtain actual carbon stocks. The result showed the PolSAR method which indicated by HV polarization is suitable for mangrove up to 40 t ha-1(R2=0.8982) while using PolInSAR, carbon stockscan be estimated up to 60 t ha-1(R2=0.6606). However, the PolSAR method indicated saturation of backscatter correlation to carbon stocks.Using the PolInSAR, based on the RVoG model, the tree height distributed from 0 to 25 meters which less than 20 meters heights dominated the study area.

At COP-21 in 2015 in Paris, Kenya has committed to a ‘nationally determined contribution’ of reducing domestic greenhouse gas emissions by 30% in 2030 in comparison to a business-as-usual projection. An efficient exploitation of the country's renewable energy resources is key to achieving this target. We use the TIAM-ECN model to characterize plausible development pathways for the Kenyan energy mix until 2050 under different climate change mitigation scenarios. We conclude that the power sector can expand with mostly renewable energy options even in the absence of stringent greenhouse gas abatement targets. On the contrary, on the demand side a substantial deployment of low-carbon technologies is triggered only when ambitious emission reduction objectives are in place. The introduction of these technologies entails additional energy system costs, ranging in 2050 from 0.5% to 2% of the country's GDP. Our analysis supports the feasibility of Kenyan climate management goals, provided that adequate investments in renewable and other low-carbon energy technologies are timely made available. © 2017","Climate change; Climate policy; Energy policy; GHG abatement; Kenya; NDC","Climate models; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy resources; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Climate change mitigation; Climate policy; GHG abatements; Greenhouse gas abatements; Kenya; Low-carbon energy technology; Low-carbon technologies; Renewable energy deployments; Climate change; abatement cost; cost analysis; emission control; energy market; energy policy; energy resource; environmental policy; exploitation; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; mitigation; renewable resource; France; Ile de France; Kenya; Paris; Ville de Paris","van der Zwaan, B.; University of Amsterdam, Netherlands",,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

Science-based knowledge that meets actors' needs supports proactive action taking. The aim of this study was to characterize the views of farmers and other rural stakeholders regarding farmers' climate change information needs, and to identify potential barriers to and necessary incentives for applying climate change mitigation and adaptation in practice. Data were collected by conducting an internet survey in Finland for which 340 responses from farmers, farm advisers and other rural stakeholders were received. Applying cluster analysis, 5 information need profiles were identified: 'information highlighters', 'globally and nationally oriented', 'livestock oriented', 'plant production oriented' and 'no interest'. Half of the respondents believed that climate change would affect their activities in the near future. Among respondent groups, farmers themselves perceived the information on climate change as most uninteresting. The complexity of the current climate change communication and potential economic costs associated with proactivity were found to hinder both mitigation and proactive adaptation actions. Based on our study, climate change communication needs to be practice-oriented and tailored to fit the needs of farmers representing different lines of agricultural production and regional locations. Such information, plus an integration of an assessment of the effects of proactive action taking on farm profitability, is needed to encourage climate change mitigation and adaptation actions on Finnish farms. © Inter-Research 2017.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change communication; Information need; Mitigation; Regional adaptation","adaptive management; agricultural production; climate change; cluster analysis; complexity; cost analysis; information management; stakeholder; Finland","Mäkinen, H.; Lappeenranta University of Technology, Saimaankatu 11, Finland; email: hanna.makinen@luke.fi",,"Inter-Research",0936577X,,,,"English","Clim.

Climate change threatens to further exacerbate this trend by increasing both the severity and duration of many natural hazards, ultimately leading to even greater costs in both human life and monetary resources. To prepare for these changes, a handful of local communities have integrated climate change into their Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved hazard mitigation plans. This paper analyzes 30 U.S. local hazard mitigation plans against a conceptual framework for how climate change could be integrated into the requirements specified in the FEMA Plan Review Crosswalk, a checklist used by FEMA to evaluate and approve local hazard mitigation plans. Results show that the majority (23/35) of communities are openly discussing how climate change could affect or already is affecting the occurrence of natural hazards. Additionally, over half also include hazard mitigation actions that are designed to be viable in a climate-altered future. These actions, however, represent only a small portion of the total actions proposed in the plans and are generally focused on researching, planning, and capacity building. In addition, few communities include a formal commitment to adapting to climate change or include clear mechanisms for integrating new climate information as it become available into plan revisions. In general, results from this analysis show that there is little consistency in how communities are integrating climate change into hazard planning.

For each strategy and spatial unit, we determined forest sector mitigation cost per tonne (t) using estimated impacts on forest sector greenhouse gas emissions and removals and net revenue. National cost curves showed that mitigation averaged 11.0 Mt CO2e·year-1 in 2015-2050 at costs below $50·t CO2e-1 for a strategy of increased recovery of harvested biomass, increased salvage, extraction of harvest residues for bioenergy, and increased production of longer lived products. We also examined national portfolios in which the strategy selected for each spatial unit (from among the seven examined) was chosen to maximize mitigation or minimize costs. At low levels of mitigation, portfolios chosen to minimize costs were much cheaper than those that maximized mitigation, but overall, they yielded less than half the total mitigation of the latter portfolios. Choosing strategies to maximize mitigation in 2015-2050 yielded an average of 16.5 Mt·year-1 at costs below $50·t CO2e-1. Our analysis suggests that forest-related strategies may be cost-effective choices to help achieve long-term emission reductions in Canada. © Her Majesty the Queen in right of Canada [2017].","Canada; Climate change mitigation; Cost; Forest management; Harvested wood products","Biomass; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Canada; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Forest products; Harvest residues; Harvested wood products; Mitigation costs; Mitigation strategy; Climate change; bioenergy; climate change; climate effect; cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; forest management; forestry production; greenhouse gas; mitigation; timber harvesting; wood; Canada; Cost Effectiveness; Forest Management; Forest Products; Greenhouse Gases; Harvesting; Canada","Lemprière, T.C.; Natural Resources Canada, 606-55 St. Clair Ave. East, Canada; email: tony.lempriere@canada.ca",,"Canadian Science Publishing",00455067,,CJFRA,,"English","Can.

These impacts include sea-level rise, more frequent floods from heavy rainfall and notably among others, intense droughts. Despite the United Nations anchored events and conferences geared towards tackling climate change, little success has been recorded till date. Biomimicry, a novel science and method that studies nature's models and then emulates their forms, processes, and strategies offer a sustainable approach to this menace of climate change. It also has the potential to offer efficient alternatives to the human activities that contribute to the depletion and pollution of the environment. Hence, the objective of this paper is to evaluate and present the potential of biomimicry in for climate change mitigation in the built environment. An extant literature review was conducted on biomimicry and its roles in tackling climate change through mitigation and adaptation. The result explores various Biomimetic innovations and applications with their potential to sustainably mitigate the menace of climate change if adopted. This study is expected to refocus human efforts towards biomimicry where it is believed that nature, during its 3.8 billion years of existence has evolved with highly efficient processes and systems, with the potential to produce solutions to the environmental challenges facing mankind, especially climate change. © 2017 The Authors.

In reality, the railway turnout is commonly built on complex track geometry and graded terrain, which makes it one of the most unique and critical railway infrastructures. The physical constraints and complexity of turnout systems cause various risks and uncertainty in rail operations. This study critically analyses emerging geotechnical risks on turnout systems considering all aspects that can potentially result in impaired reliability, availability, maintainability and safety (RAMS) of the turnout systems. The annual derailment incidents have been evaluated to identify emerging risk factors. Not only do these incidents yield operational downtime and financial losses, but they also give rise to the casualties and sometimes the loss of lives across the world. In particular, the climate change risks on geotechnical aspects of the turnout systems have been highlighted. This paper thus presents how turnout components work as a system, the diversity of emerging risks considering natural hazards and global warming potential to the system. In addition, it highlights the climate change adaptation strategies for georisk mitigation of the railway turnout systems in order to improve RAMS of the railway turnouts and crossings, focusing on trackbed failures on the systems. © 2017 The Authors.

The main objective of this work is to review the existing work on the evaluation of climate and energy policies considering the difficulties that come along with the assessment of the effects of local actions. In order to do so, an analytical framework composed by the following features was developed: moment of the evaluation; object; geographical scope; causal links consideration; and merit assessment. Despite the existence of several studies that may contribute to the assessment of local actions, the reviewed approaches do not fully assess the contribution of local actions towards climate change mitigation – either by not decoupling its effects from other ongoing or past policies or by not providing their merit assessment. Nevertheless, the analysis of existing approaches was important to acknowledge the implications of different options, providing some guidelines for the development of an improved evaluation methodology.

High yield biochar can be produced through torrefaction or slow pyrolysis. The efficiency of biochar production from biomass is highly dependent on the pyrolysis temperature, heating rate, type and composition of feedstock, particle size, and reactor conditions. Application of biochar to agriculture may have a significant effect on reducing global warming through the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the sequestering of atmospheric carbon into soil. At the same time, biochar can help improve soil health and fertility, and enhance agricultural production. Livestock manure, along with waste-feed residues and bedding materials, is a potential source of biochar. This waste emits significant amounts of GHGs adding to global warming and threatening the environment in other ways. The environmental challenges caused by agricultural and animal-waste disposal can be reduced by recycling the waste using pyrolysis, into biochar, energy, and value-added products. Biochar can act as a sorbent for organic and inorganic contaminants and can efficiently remove these materials from affected waters. Contaminant removal is mainly based on the presence of functional groups and charges on the surface of the biochar. Thus, biochar can help to improve food security by contributing to sustainable production systems and maintaining an eco-friendly environment. This review details the principles and concepts involved in biochar production, the factors that affect biochar quality, as well as the applications of biochar. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Carbon sequestration; GHG mitigation; Soil fertility; Waste management; Wastewater treatment","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Climate change; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Food supply; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Impurities; Oils and fats; Particle size; Pyrolysis; Radioactive waste disposal; Soils; Sustainable development; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Agricultural productions; Bio chars; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Environmental challenges; GHG mitigation; Inorganic contaminants; Soil fertility; Waste management","Ra, C.; Division of Animal Resource Sciences, South Korea; email: changsix@kangwon.ac.kr",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019370629

Firstly, the systematic review found a total of 301 research articles from Scopus and Web of Science databases and finally analysed 154 articles based on inclusion and exclusion criteria from 67 refereed journals. The review analysis found that application of CGE model is very vital in addressing climate change mitigation issues at the national, regional and global levels. However, China attracted the most substantial research interests followed by the USA, India and Australia, among others, which are in line with their share of greenhouse gas emissions in the world. Most of the research themes focus on the carbon tax, emission reduction target, emission trading, renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon capture and storage as primary drivers of low carbon economy.

Reducing this energy consumption will be critical for countries to achieve their national greenhouse gas reduction commitments. The ISO 50001-Energy management standard provides a continual improvement framework for organizations to reduce their consumption. Several national policies already support ISO 50001; however, there is no transparent, consistent process to estimate the potential impacts of its implementation. This paper presents the ISO 50001 Impacts Methodology, an internationally-developed methodology to calculate these impacts at a national, regional, or global scale suitable for use by policymakers. The recently-formed ISO 50001 Global Impacts Research Network provides a forum for policymakers to refine and encourage use of the methodology. Using this methodology, a scenario with 50% of projected global industrial and service sector energy consumption under ISO 50001 management by 2030 would generate cumulative primary energy savings of approximately 105 EJ, cost savings of nearly US $700 billion (discounted to 2016 net present value), and 6500 million metric tons (Mt) of avoided CO2 emissions. The avoided annual CO2 emissions in 2030 alone are equivalent to removing 210 million passenger vehicles from the road. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation; Energy management; Energy savings; Greenhouse gas emissions; ISO 50001; Savings methodology","Carbon dioxide; Crashworthiness; Energy conservation; Energy management; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gas reductions; ISO 50001; Management standards; Passenger vehicles; Potential impacts; Primary energy savings; Savings methodology; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; management practice; policy implementation; policy making; prediction","Therkelsen, P.; Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, One Cyclotron Road, United States; email: ptherkelsen@lbl.gov",,"Elsevier Ltd",03014215,,ENPYA,,"English","Energy Policy",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Bronze",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018795022

The greater awareness of the need to mitigate climate variability has brought about intense focus on the adverse impacts of fossil-fuel based energy on the environment. Being the single largest source of carbon emissions, energy supply has attracted much attention and more so that, climate change impacts extend beyond national boundaries. Since energy use is sine qua non to economic development, scientists have reiterated the necessity of developing and utilising renewable energy. Although, past and present CO2 emissions have and are majorly caused by industrialized countries, it is envisaged that future GHGs emissions would be mostly from developing countries as they industrialize. Renewable energy sources that include biomass, hydroelectric, wind, solar and hydrothermal systems, are carbon-neutral, releasing relatively no emissions. This paper discusses the initiatives associated with the provision of renewable energy to the energy mix in Nigeria as an indication of the country's commitment to adopt a sustainable development strategy in shaping the economy. It reviews the literature and employs a discourse analysis to examine the limited use of renewable energy sources in Nigeria and the factors prevailing against their development. The paper concludes by identifying social and political obstacles as most significant roadblocks towards rapid implementation of a green economy through the deployment of renewable energy for sustainable development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Emissions; Fossil fuels; Renewable energy; Sustainable development","Carbon; Developing countries; Economics; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Anthropogenic activity; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Economic development; Industrialized countries; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Use of renewable energies; Climate change","Elum, Z.A.; Department of Agriculture and Animal Health, South Africa; email: zelda.elum@uniport.edu.ng",,"Elsevier Ltd",13640321,,RSERF,,"English","Renewable Sustainable Energy Rev",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015363641

Sunflower, a spring-sown crop often cultivated in southern and eastern regions of Europe, could be more vulnerable to the direct effect of heat stress at anthesis and drought during its growing cycle, both factors resulting in severe yield loss, oil content decrease, and fatty acid alterations. Adaptations through breeding (earliness, stress tolerance), crop management (planting dates), and shifting of growing areas could be developed, assessed and combined to partly cope with these negative impacts. New cultivation opportunities could be expected in northern parts of Europe where sunflower is not grown presently and where it could usefully contribute to diversify cereal-based cropping systems. In addition, sunflower crop could participate to the mitigation solution as a low greenhouse gas emitter compared to cereals and oilseed rape. Sunflower crop models should be revised to account for these emerging environmental factors in order to reduce the uncertainties in yield and oil predictions. The future of sunflower in Europe is probably related to its potential adaptation to climate change but also to its competitiveness and attractiveness for food and energy. © 2017 P.

Bioenergy is an alternative renewable source which can mitigate a climate change. Little is known about the human health and ecosystem effects of bioenergy, mainly in the electricity sector. This research applied a life cycle assessment approach to examine the human health and ecosystem effects of four bioenergy pathways: direct combustion of wood biomass, direct combustion of forest residue, direct combustion of pellets, and biomass integrated gasification and combined cycle (BIGCC). All pathways showed some variability of impacts; therefore, no single bioenergy pathway was the best absolute option. With the exception of the slightly higher human health impact, BIGCC has the least impact for all impact categories. However, all bioenergy systems implied lower ecosystem impact but higher human health impact as compared to climate change impact. Electricity generation from wood-biomass would improve the environmental sustainability of Alberta's electricity grid system because it reduces the human health and ecosystem impacts, as compared to the existing electricity production mix of the province. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Ecosystem; Electricity; Human health; LCA; Sustainability","Artificial life; Biomass; Combustion; Ecosystems; Electricity; Health; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Bio-energy; Biomass integrated gasification; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Electricity Grid systems; Environmental sustainability; Human health; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Climate change; atmospheric pollution; bioenergy; biomass; climate change; combustion; environmental impact; environmental quality; health impact; life cycle analysis; pollution exposure; public health; renewable resource; smart grid; sustainability; Alberta; Canada",,,"Elsevier Ltd",09601481,,,,"English","Renew.

Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70% growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures. © 2017","Adaptation; Climate change; Greenhouse gas; Heat stress; Livestock; Mitigation",,"Nejadhashemi, A.P.; Department of Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering, 524 S.

A downscaling empirical dynamic model is constructed using a dual multidisciplinary framework combining economic, earth science, and ecological variables to analyse the long-run consequences. The model takes account of climatic variables, including carbon cycle, carbon emission, climatic damage, carbon control, carbon concentration, and temperature. The results indicate that without optimal climate policy and action, the cumulative cost of climate damage for Malaysia and ASEAN as a whole over the period 2010–2110 would be MYR40.1 trillion and MYR151.0 trillion, respectively.

Previous research indicates that experiencing extreme weather events has the potential to heighten engagement with climate change, however the process by which this occurs remains largely unknown, and establishing a clear causal relationship from experience to perceptions is methodologically challenging. The UK winter flooding offered a natural experiment to examine this question in detail. We compare individuals personally affected by flooding (n = 162) to a nationally representative sample (n = 975). We show that direct experience of flooding leads to an overall increased salience of climate change, pronounced emotional responses and greater perceived personal vulnerability and risk perceptions. We also present the first evidence that direct flooding experience can give rise to behavioural intentions beyond individual sustainability actions, including support for mitigation policies, and personal climate adaptation in matters unrelated to the direct experience. © 2016, The Author(s).",,"Behavioral research; Floods; Risk perception; Storms; Adaptation response; Behavioural intentions; Causal relationships; Climate change mitigation; Extreme weather events; Flooding experiences; Mitigation policies; Representative sample; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; environmental response; extreme event; flooding; nature-society relations; risk perception; storm surge; vulnerability; weather; winter; United Kingdom","Demski, C.; Understanding Risk Research Group, United Kingdom; email: DemskiCC@cardiff.ac.uk",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

There is even less land management and soil moisture data, which are needed to track climate change mitigation activities since soil moisture is one of the main drivers of GHG emissions of organic soils. Information is also needed for the reporting of land-based activities such as grazing land management or wetland drainage and rewetting of organic soils. Different spatial and thematic resolutions of land-use data produce inconsistent time series with a strong overestimation of land-use change (LUC) if not adequately accounted for. Our aim was to create a consistent time series of land use since 1990 that is in line with GHG reporting under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol by combining official cadastral data with colour-infrared aerial photography used for biodiversity monitoring in six federal states in northern and eastern Germany. We developed a generic hierarchical classification by land use, management and drainage status, and a translation key for data harmonisation into a consistent time series. This time series enabled the quantification of LUC on organic soils between 1992 and 2013 in a spatially explicit manner. Furthermore we used this time series to develop indicators for changes in land management and drainage to evaluate the success of protection statuses on peatland restoration. The study area encompassed one million hectares, half of which had some type of legal nature protection status. Areas with no protection status tended to become more intensively farmed and drier, while highly protected areas (e.g. Natura 2000) showed the opposite trend. Land-use trends also differed greatly between federal states. In Schleswig-Holstein organic soils tended to become drier during the study period, while in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania they tended to become wetter overall. The trends and differences in LUC between federal states were linked to German reunification, changes in the European Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and Germany's Renewable Energy Act (EEG). A large-scale peatland protection programme also had major impact. In conclusion, our study demonstrates how data derived for biodiversity monitoring and other highly detailed land-use data can be used to track changes in land use, management and drainage status in accordance with the reporting requirements under the UNFCCC and the Kyoto Protocol. © 2016 The Author(s)","Greenhouse gas inventory; Kyoto Protocol; Land-use change; Peatland; Rewetting; Time series consistency","Aerial photography; Agriculture; Biodiversity; Climatology; Conservation; Environmental regulations; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International cooperation; Land use; Moisture; Soil moisture; Soils; Time series; Wetlands; Greenhouse gas inventory; KYOTO protocol; Land-use change; Peatland; Re-wetting; Climate change; aerial photography; biodiversity; climate change; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; land management; land use change; organic soil; peatland; protected area; restoration ecology; rewetting; time series analysis; wetland; Germany; Mecklenburg-West Pomerania; Schleswig-Holstein","Untenecker, J.; Thünen-Institute of Climate Smart Agriculture, Germany; email: Johanna.untenecker@thuenen.de",,"Elsevier B.V.",1470160X,,,,"English","Ecol.

Packages of mitigation techniques can bring large environmental benefits as illustrated in six case studies modeled in the Global Livestock Environmental Assessment Model developed by FAO. With feasible technical interventions in livestock production systems, the mitigation potential of each of the selected species, systems and regions ranges from 14 to 41 %. While comparably high mitigation potentials were estimated for ruminant and pig production systems in Asia, Latin America and Africa, large emission reductions can also be attained in dairy systems with already high levels of productivity, in OECD countries. Mitigation interventions can lead to a concomitant reduction in emissions and increase in production, contributing to food security. This is particularly the case for improved feeding practices and better health and herd management practices. Livestock systems also have a significant potential for sequestrating carbon in pasturelands and rangelands through improved management, as illustrated in two of the six case studies in this paper. © 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; Livestock systems; Mitigation; Packages of options; Productivity",,"Mottet, A.; UN Food and Agriculture Organization, Viale delle Terme di Caracalla, Italy; email: anne.mottet@fao.org",,"Springer Verlag",14363798,,,,"English","Reg.

Results find significant opportunity: between 2015 and 2030, BAU levels of CO2 emissions could be reduced by 10.2% in Beijing and 6.8% in Shanghai with the adoption of economically attractive low carbon measures. While these headline results underline the case for low carbon investment in the residential sectors of these megacities in China, a closer analysis provides insights for understanding the economics of decarbonisation in cities more generally. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon; Climate change; Energy; Measures-based analysis; Megacities; Residential buildings","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Economics; Housing; Investments; Climate change mitigation; Decarbonisation; Energy; Investment opportunities; Measures-based analysis; Megacities; Residential building; Residential sectors; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; economic analysis; emission control; energy use; environmental economics; megacity; residential location; suburbanization; Beijing [China]; China; Shanghai","He, Q.; Ministry of Education Key Laboratory for Earth System Modeling, China; email: heqi0788@mail.tsinghua.edu.cn",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

Next, the implications of these characteristics for the production of policy responses to climate change risks were discussed. The two main types of policy responses to climate change in the literature were presented: mitigation and adaptation. Finally, their interaction, differences and possibilities for synergy were analyzed. Understanding climate change as a contemporary environmental risk, the way it was presented in this article, implies a radical change in the development bases of society, since greenhouse gases emissions from human activities contribute to the aggravation of global warming. Climate change challenges the traditional ways of governing in many ways, since climate change policy should involve the questioning of the current processes of development.

As these side-effects involve substantial uncertainties, the optimal role of SRM cannot be yet determined. Here, we present probabilistic emission scenarios that limit global mean temperature increase to 2 °C under uncertainty on possible future SRM deployment. Three uncertainties relating to SRM deployment are covered: the start time, intensity and possible termination. We find that the uncertain SRM option allows very little additional GHG emissions before the SRM termination risk can be excluded, and the result proved robust over different hypothetical probability assumptions for SRM deployment. An additional CO2 concentration constraint, e.g. to mitigate ocean acidification, necessitates CO2 reductions even with strong SRM; but in such case SRM renders non-CO2 reductions unnecessary. This illustrates how the framing of climatic targets and available mitigation measures affect strongly the optimal mitigation strategies. The ability of SRM to decrease emission reduction costs is diminished by the uncertainty in SRM deployment and the possible concentration constraint, and also depends heavily on the assumed emission reduction costs. By holding SRM deployment time uncertain, we also find that carrying out safeguard emission reductions and delaying SRM deployment by 10 to 20 years increases reduction costs only moderately. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Costs; Emission control; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Radiation effects; Risk perception; Solar radiation; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Emission scenario; Global-mean temperature; Mitigation measures; Ocean acidifications; Optimal mitigation; Radiation management; Climate change; carbon emission; climate change; climate effect; concentration (composition); cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; environmental management; greenhouse gas; probability; solar radiation; temperature effect","Ekholm, T.; VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, Vuorimiehentie 3, Finland; email: tommi.ekholm@vtt.fi",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

To stay within ‘safe’ global warming guardrails requires substantial cuts in greenhouse gas emissions. This represents a global political consensus, but there is evidence that current legislation in the transport sector is not significant enough to achieve medium- and longer-term reduction goals. In focusing on the European Union, this paper investigates the perspectives of twelve policy officers in three Directorates-General (MOVE, CLIMA, ENV) of the European Commission with regard to their understanding of mitigation goals and timelines, responsibilities for policy development and implementation, and perceived efficiencies of these policies to achieve climate objectives in the transport sector. Results indicate diverging and common views on climate policy goals and political responsibilities, as well as barriers to policy-making, including lack of political leadership on climate change mitigation, resistance from member states, the favoring of economic growth over cuts in greenhouse gas emissions, pressure from industry and lobby groups, preferential treatment of aero- and automobility over more sustainable transport modes, policy implementation delays, insufficient forecasting and monitoring tools, and an overreliance on technologies to contribute to emission reductions. In offering a view inside the ‘black box’ of transport policy-making, the paper reveals fundamental institutional (structural) and individual (agency-based) barriers that will have to be overcome if significant emission cuts in the transport sector are to be achieved. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Climate policy; Directorate generals; European Union; Governance; Policy; Transport","climate change; emission control; European Union; governance approach; policy development; policy implementation; policy making; regional policy; Europe","Gössling, S.; School of Business and Economics, Sweden; email: stefan.gossling@lnu.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",09666923,,,,"English","J.

These physical impacts will in turn have economic consequences through both producer revenues and consumer expenditures. We analyze the physical and economic effects of changes in hydropower generation for the contiguous U.S. in futures with and without global-scale greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, and across patterns from 18 General Circulation Models. Using a monthly water resources systems model of 2119 river basins that routes simulated river runoff through reservoirs, and allocates water to potentially conflicting and climate dependent demands, we provide a first-order estimate of the impacts of various projected emissions outcomes on hydropower generation, and monetize these impacts using outputs from an electric sector planning model for over 500 of the largest U.S. hydropower facilities. We find that, due to generally increasing river runoff under higher emissions scenarios in the Pacific Northwest, climate change tends to increase overall hydropower generation in the contiguous U.S. During low flow months, generation tends to fall with increasing emissions, potentially threatening the estimated low flow, firm energy from hydropower. Although global GHG mitigation slows the growth in hydropower generation, the higher value placed on carbon-free hydropower leads to annual economic benefits ranging from $1.8 billion to $4.3 billion. The present value of these benefits to the U.S. from global greenhouse gas mitigation, discounted at 3%, is $34 to $45 billion over the 2015–2050 period. © 2016 The Authors","Climate change; Economic impacts; Energy; Greenhouse gases; Hydropower; Mitigation","Carbon; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power; Rivers; Runoff; Water resources; Economic impacts; Energy; General circulation model; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Hydro-power generation; Hydropower; Mitigation; Water resources systems; Climate change; climate change; economic impact; emission inventory; environmental planning; global perspective; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; power generation; runoff; Pacific Northwest; United States","Boehlert, B.; Industrial Economics, United States; email: bboehlert@indecon.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",03062619,,APEND,,"English","Appl.

These smallholder systems are characterized by high greenhouse gas emission rates, but could play a role in their mitigation. Although the impact of climate change is projected to be large, many uncertainties persist, in particular with respect to impacts on livestock and grazing components, whole-farm dynamics and heterogeneous farm populations. We summarize the current understanding on impacts and vulnerability and highlight key knowledge gaps for the separate system components and the mixed farming systems as a whole. Numerous adaptation and mitigation options exist for crop–livestock systems. We provide an overview by distinguishing risk management, diversification and sustainable intensification strategies, and by focusing on the contribution to the three pillars of climate-smart agriculture. Despite the potential solutions, smallholders face major constraints at various scales, including small farm sizes, the lack of response to the proposed measures and the multi-functionality of the livestock herd. Major institutional barriers include poor access to markets and relevant knowledge, land tenure insecurity and the common property status of most grazing resources. These limit the adoption potential and hence the potential impact on resilience and mitigation. In order to effectively inform decision-making, we therefore call for integrated, system-oriented impact assessments and a realistic consideration of the adoption constraints in smallholder systems. Building on agricultural system model development, integrated impact assessments and scenario analyses can inform the co-design and implementation of adaptation and mitigation strategies.F © 2016, The Author(s).","Agricultural model; Farm size; Farming systems analysis; Food security; Poverty; Risk",,"Descheemaeker, K.; Plant Production Systems, PO Box 430, Netherlands; email: katrien.descheemaeker@wur.nl",,"Springer Verlag",14363798,,,,"English","Reg.

However, uncertainties relating to emission reductions and the timeframe for these reductions are increasingly recognised as challenges whether bioenergy can deliver the required reductions. This paper discusses and highlights the challenges and the importance of the real greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction potential of bioenergy systems and its relevance for a global 450 ppm CO2e stabilisation target in terms of uncertainties and temporal aspects. The authors aim to raise awareness and emphasise the need for dynamic and consequential approaches for the evaluation of climate change impacts of bioenergy systems to capture the complexity and challenges of their real emission reduction potential within a 2 °C target. This review does not present new research results. This paper shows the variety of challenges and complexity of the problem of achieving real GHG emission reductions from bioenergy systems. By reflecting on current evaluation methods of emissions and impacts from bioenergy systems, this review points out that a rethinking and going beyond static approaches is required, considering each bioenergy systems according to its own characteristics, context and feedbacks. With the development of knowledge and continuously changing systems, policies should be designed in a way that they provide a balance between flexibility to adapt to new information and planning security for investors. These will then allow considering if a bioenergy system will deliver the required emission saving in the appropriate timeframe or not. © 2016, Röder and Thornley.","2 °C target; 450 ppm CO2e stabilisation target; Bioenergy; Climate change; Cumulative emissions; Emission reductions; Temporal aspects; Uncertainties","Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Stabilization; Bio-energy; Cumulative emissions; Emission reduction; Temporal aspects; Uncertainties; Climate change; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; stabilization; temporal analysis; uncertainty analysis","Röder, M.; Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, Oxford Road, United Kingdom; email: mirjam.roeder@manchester.ac.uk",,"Springer Verlag",21920567,,,,"English","Energy Sustainability Soc.",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84959509940

In the developed world this wastage is centred on the last stage in the supply chain; the end-consumer throwing away food that is purchased but not eaten. In contrast, in the developing world the bulk of lost food occurs in the early stages of the supply chain (production, harvesting and distribution). Excess food consumption is a similarly inefficient use of global agricultural production; with almost 1 billion people now classed as obese, 842 million people are suffering from chronic hunger. Given the magnitude of greenhouse gas emissions from the agricultural sector, strategies that reduce food loss and wastage, or address excess caloric consumption, have great potential as effective tools in global climate change mitigation. Here, we examine the challenges of robust quantification of food wastage and consumption inefficiencies, and their associated greenhouse gas emissions, along the supply chain. We find that the quality and quantity of data are highly variable within and between geographical regions, with the greatest range tending to be associated with developing nations. Estimation of production-phase GHG emissions for food wastage and excess consumption is found to be similarly challenging on a global scale, with use of IPCC default (Tier 1) emission factors for food production being required in many regions. Where robust food waste data and production-phase emission factors do exist—such as for the UK—we find that avoiding consumer-phase food waste can deliver significant up-stream reductions in GHG emissions from the agricultural sector. Eliminating consumer milk waste in the UK alone could mitigate up to 200 Gg CO2e year−1; scaled up globally, we estimate mitigation potential of over 25,000 Gg CO2e year−1. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Agriculture; Climate change mitigation; Food waste; Greenhouse gas; Supply chain",,"Porter, S.D.; University of Edinburgh, United Kingdom; email: Stephen.Porter@ed.ac.uk",,"Springer Verlag",14363798,,,,"English","Reg.

Host plants and their pathogens are prone to various climatic factors like temperature, relative humidity, rainfall and CO2 which are behaving in erratic manner. Phytophthora infestans has adapted itself at higher temperature so there are chances to spread at a larger area. The other potato diseases like early blight, bacterial wilt, soft rot and viral diseases may also behave differently at elevated temperature and high rainfall. Viral diseases of potato are serious threat to potato industry as most of the viruses are transmitted by vectors and vector populations are bound to increase with these changed climatic conditions.

These rains are not only insufficient to grow even a single crop without artificial irrigation but also cause flood havoc very frequently that is associated with the climate change. The Indus river transports water for agriculture, industry and domestic usage within the basin and downstream. The Indus Basin is among the few basins severely affected by global warming and resulting climate change. The alteration in temporal and spatial patterns of rainfall has resulted in unexpected drought and floods. About 70 to 80% of total river flows occur in summer season due to snow melt and monsoonal rainfalls. Lack of storage reservoirs has decreased the ability to regulate flood water as well as its potential use during the drought season along with cheap hydro-electricity generation. The sedimentation in the system has limited the storage capacity of the existing three reservoirs by 28%. Consequently carry over capacity of these storage structures is only 30 days compared to 120 to 220 days in India and 900 days in Colorado Basin. Pakistan is facing shortage of good quality water due to competition among agricultural and non-agricultural sectors, this scenario will continue rather will further aggravate in future. According to the climate change scenario, the warming is reflected in the river-flow data of Pakistan, especially during the past 2-3 decades. To bridge the gap between fresh water availability and demand, ground water is being pumped to meet the irrigation requirements of crops. The prolonged agricultural uses of such water will deteriorate soils, crops and human living environments. Water quality parameters usually considered include electrical conductivity (EC) for total soluble salts, and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and residual sodium carbonate (RSC) reflect the sodicity hazards. In order to limit or even to eliminate adverse effects of such waters, certain treatment and/or management options are considered as important pre-requisites. For bringing down high concentration of total soluble salts, dilution with good quality water is the doable practice. To decrease high SAR of irrigation water, a source of calcium is needed, dilution (with good quality water) will decrease SAR by the square root times of the dilution factor, while use of acids will be cost-intensive rather may adversely impact the soil health. For high RSC, dilution with low CO32- + HCO3- water will serve the purpose, addition of Ca-salts will raise Ca2++Mg2+ to bring a decrease in water RSC, while acids will neutralize CO32- + HCO3- to lower water RSC. Gypsum is the most economical and safe amendment while acids could also decrease RSC but at higher relative cost. City wastewater and seed priming in aerated gypsum solution is also presented. Such practices at small and/or large scale surely will help a lot to sustain the food security and the environment in the days to come where climate change has to be experienced round the world. Therefore, a well-coordinated program is necessary to create awareness among different sections of the society including the policy makers, general public, organizations, industrialists and farmers. © 2017 by IGI Global.

To date, actions proposed by the international community to address these problems have largely been conducted in a piecemeal fashion. Conservation biologists advocate for low-intensity management in temperate protected areas to maintain and restore biodiversity. Low-input, high-diversity biomass from such areas has been proposed as a promising alternative bioenergy feedstock. Here, we show that there is a vast unexploited biomass-for-bioenergy potential present in Natura 2000, the European nature conservation network. Spanning 7.5 million hectares (ha), non-forest ecosystems within Natura 2000 have a biomass production of 17.9 teragrams (Tg) of dry matter annually. The conversion of this biomass to bioenergy will not lead to the displacement of food production systems, thereby avoiding 12.5 Tg of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse-gas emissions and circumventing between 1.2 and 2.8 million ha of indirect land-use change. The use of conservation biomass as bioenergy feedstock clearly offers the opportunity to reconcile biodiversity goals and climate-change mitigation. © The Ecological Society of America",,"biodiversity; bioenergy; biomass; carbon dioxide; climate change; conservation status; food production; greenhouse gas; land use change; nature conservation; protected area; twenty first century","Van Meerbeek, K.; Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences, Belgium; email: koenraad.vanmeerbeek@kuleuven.be",,"Wiley Blackwell",15409295,,,,"English","Frontiers Ecol.

The evidence also shows how policy ‘nudges’ that account for the influence of cognitive factors can shift choices in socially desirable directions. Despite a wide range of potential applications, little research has been published to date applying behavioural economics in forestry. As an example of how behavioural economics could be used, this paper considers the potential for nudges in encouraging woodland creation to help meet climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. Although forests offer significant climate change mitigation and adaptation potential, land managers are often reluctant to create new woodlands, hindering accomplishment of national targets. Nudges could potentially help overcome the barriers. Disaggregating behavioural elements of woodland creation using the Stages of Change model, we identify a number of relevant intervention points at which nudges could be applied. It is argued that nudges may best be tailored towards different types of land manager taking account of differences in attitudes, motivations, circumstances and behaviour. To be effective, a combination with other policy instruments is likely to be needed. Pilot studies are recommended in determining which nudges are cost-effective. The paucity of existing studies drawing upon behavioural economics, or testing out nudges, points to this as a current frontier of both forest economics and policy, but can also be considered a frontier of environmental policy more widely. Developing a consistent valuation framework allowing for the social endogeneity of preferences and for optimization (or some other protocol) to be used in selecting policy options remains a fundamental challenge. © 2016","Afforestation; Behavioural economics; Climate change; Environmental economics; Nudge; Public policy","Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economics; Environmental protection; Forestry; Managers; Public policy; Reforestation; Afforestation; Climate change mitigation; Cognitive factors; Environmental economics; Environmental policy; Forest economics; Nudge; Policy instruments; Climate change","Valatin, G.; Forest Research, Alice Holt Lodge, United Kingdom; email: Gregory.Valatin@forestry.gsi.gov.uk",,"Elsevier B.V.",13899341,,FPEOA,,"English","For.

With greenhouse gases (GHG) being emitted from far-ranging anthropogenic sources, selecting mitigation alternatives from a portfolio of options can be highly challenging, particularly when capital budgets and life cycle costs are considered. This research combines life cycle assessment (LCA), life cycle cost accounting (LCCA), and mathematical formulation methods to select ideal alternatives for a case study city. We utilize LCA and LCCA to determine the environmental and economic costs associated with 15 different GHG emission abatement alternatives in four different infrastructure systems: lighting, transportation, buildings, and energy. These abatement alternatives are also assessed for high, medium, and low emission reduction scenarios. For this problem we propose two mathematical formulations to apply to the LCA and LCCA results. The first mathematical formulation is for a single-phase implementation of all selected solution design alternatives; the second mathematical formulation applies to the implementation of alternatives done in three phases. The modeling results reveal the selection differences that occur when capital budgets are varied for both single and multi-phase planning. This unique approach to urban GHG abatement planning can effectively aid policy makers in efficiently selecting best practices in climate change mitigation when balancing environmental and economic perspectives. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Life cycle assessment; Life cycle costs; Mathematical formulation","Budget control; Cost accounting; Costs; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Urban planning; Anthropogenic sources; Climate change mitigation; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Infrastructure systems; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle perspectives; Lifecycle costs; Mathematical formulation; Climate change","Rakas, J.; Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, United States; email: jrakas@berkeley.edu",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

As with crop-based agriculture, the sector is both a net greenhouse gas emitter and vulnerable to climate change. At the same time, it is an essential food source for millions of people worldwide, with other functions apart from food security such as savings and insurance. By comparison with crop-based agriculture, the interactions of livestock and climate change have been much less studied. The debate around livestock is confusing due to the coexistence of multiple livestock farming systems with differing functions for humans, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission profiles and different characteristics and boundary issues in their measurement, which are often pooled together. Consequently, the diversity of livestock farming systems and their functions to human systems are poorly represented and the role of the livestock sector in the climate change debate has not been adequately addressed. In this article, building upon the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC 5AR) findings, we review recent literature on livestock and climate change so as better to include this diversity in the adaptation and mitigation debate around livestock systems. For comparative purposes we use the same categories of managerial, technical, behavioral and policy-related action to organize both mitigation and adaptation options. We conclude that different livestock systems provide different functions to different human systems and require different strategies, so they cannot readily be pooled together. We also observe that, for the different livestock systems, several win-win strategies exist that effectively tackle both mitigation and adaptation options as well as food security.

Current integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios assume that CDR within the energy sector would be delivered using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Although bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS) can also deliver CDR, they are not included in any IPCC scenario. Here we show that despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices when long-term improvements in soil fertility offset biochar production costs. At carbon prices above $1,000 Mg -1 C, BECCS is most frequently (P&gt;0.45, calculated as the fraction of Monte Carlo simulations in which BECCS is the most cost effective) the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation.

A variety of vehicle technologies and fuels are commercially available to consumers today that can reduce the emissions of the transportation sector. Yet what are the best options, and do any suffice to meet climate policy targets? Here, we examine the costs and carbon intensities of 125 light-duty vehicle models on the U.S. market today and evaluate these models against U.S. emission-reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 that are compatible with the goal of limiting mean global temperature rise to 2 °C above preindustrial levels. Our results show that consumers are not required to pay more for a low-carbon-emitting vehicle. Across the diverse set of vehicle models and powertrain technologies examined, a clean vehicle is usually a low-cost vehicle. Although the average carbon intensity of vehicles sold in 2014 exceeds the climate target for 2030 by more than 50%, we find that most hybrid and battery electric vehicles available today meet this target. By 2050, only electric vehicles supplied with almost completely carbon-free electric power are expected to meet climate-policy targets. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Battery electric vehicles; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Vehicles; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction targets; Global climate changes; Global temperatures; Light duty vehicles; Pre-industrial levels; Transportation sector; Vehicle technology; Climate change; carbon; carbon; exhaust gas; climate change; electric vehicle; emission control; environmental policy; future prospect; global climate; greenhouse gas; mitigation; technological change; transportation system; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; consumer; cost; market; motor vehicle; temperature; traffic and transport; climate; exhaust gas; United States; Carbon; Climate; Climate Change; Motor Vehicles; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions","Trancik, J.E.; Institute for Data, United States; email: trancik@mit.edu",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"27676468","English","Environ.

However, many solutions to climate change mitigation misalign with such analytical frameworks. Here, we examine demand-side solutions, a crucial class of mitigation options that go beyond technological specification and cost-benefit analysis. To do so, we synthesize demand-side mitigation options in the urban, building, transport, and agricultural sectors. We also highlight the specific nature of demand-side solutions in the context of development. We then discuss key analytical considerations to integrate demand-side options into overarching assessments on mitigation. Such a framework would include infrastructure solutions that interact with endogenous preference formation. Both hard infrastructures, such as the built environment, and soft infrastructures, such as habits and norms, shape behavior and as a consequence offer significant potential for reducing overall energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions. We conclude that systemic infrastructural and behavioral change will likely be a necessary component of a transition to a low-carbon society.

This review aimed to identify key biochar properties and production parameters that have an effect on these specific applications of the biochar. Moreover, mechanisms involved in interactions between biochar and soils were highlighted. Following a compilation and comparison of the characteristics of 76 biochars from 40 research studies, biochars with a lower N content, and consequently a higher C/N ratio (&gt;30), were found to be more suitable for mitigation of N2O emissions from soils. Moreover, biochars produced at a higher pyrolysis temperature, and with O/C ratio &lt;0.2, H/Corg ratio &lt;0.4 and volatile matter below 80% may have high C sequestration potential. Based on these observations, biochar production and application to the field can be used as a tool to mitigate climate change. However, it is important to determine the pyrolysis conditions and feedstock needed to produce a biochar with the desired properties for a specific application. More research studies are needed to identify the exact mechanisms involved following biochar amendment to soil. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Carbon sequestration; Emissions; Greenhouse gas; Soil","carbon; methane; nitric oxide; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; nitrogen; soil; biofuel; carbon sequestration; charcoal; climate change; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon seep; mitigation; nitrous oxide; pyrolysis; soil amendment; soil emission; adsorption; aeration; ash; atmospheric deposition; biochar; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; chemical composition; chemical structure; climate change; environmental factor; methanogen; microorganism; nonhuman; pH; Review; soil; soil amendment; soil and soil related phenomena; systematic review; biomass; chemistry; environmental policy; greenhouse effect; metabolism; prevention and control; procedures; soil; waste management; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Climate Change; Environmental Policy; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrogen; Soil; Waste Management","Brassard, P.; Research and Development Institute for the Agri-Environment (IRDA), 2700 Einstein Street, Canada; email: patrick.brassard@irda.qc.ca",,"Academic Press",03014797,,JEVMA,"27420171","English","J.

We use an integrated modelling framework of the water-energy-land-climate systems to assess how changes in electricity and land use, induced by climate change mitigation, impact on water demand under alternative socioeconomic (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways) and water policy assumptions (irrigation of bioenergy crops, cooling technologies for electricity generation). The impacts of climate change mitigation on cumulated global water demand across the century are highly uncertain, and depending on socioeconomic and water policy conditions, they range from a reduction of 15,000 km3 to an increase of more than 160,000 km3. The impact of irrigation of bioenergy crops is the most prominent factor, leading to significantly higher water requirements under climate change mitigation if bioenergy crops are irrigated. Differences in socioeconomic drivers and fossil fuel availability result in significant differences in electricity and bioenergy demands, in the associated electricity and primary energy mixes, and consequently in water demand. Economic affluence and abundance of fossil fuels aggravate pressures on water resources due to higher energy demand and greater deployment of water intensive technologies such as bioenergy and nuclear power. The evolution of future cooling systems is also identified as an important determinant of electricity water demand. Climate policy can result in a reduction of water demand if combined with policies on irrigation of bioenergy, and the deployment of non-water-intensive electricity sources and cooling types. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Climate change mitigation; Electricity; Shared socioeconomic pathways; Water demand; Water policy","water; Article; bioenergy; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; electric power plant; electricity; energy resource; environmental planning; fluid intake; food; hydropower; irrigation (agriculture); nuclear energy; priority journal; socioeconomics; vegetation; water availability; water supply","Mouratiadou, I.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, P.O.

We discuss mitigation measures for Japan based on model projections. The integrated model included the forest model and the wood use model. Based on three scenarios (baseline, moderate increase, and rapid increase) of harvesting and wood use, the integrated model projected mitigation effects including carbon removal by forests and emission reduction through the wider use of wood, until 2050. Results indicate that forests will not become a source of net carbon emissions under the three scenarios considered. The baseline scenario is most effective for mitigating climate change, for most periods. However, the sum total of carbon removal in forests and carbon emission reductions by wood use under the rapid increase scenario exceeded the one of the moderate increase scenario after 2043. This was because of strong mitigation activities: promoting replanting, using new high-yield varieties, and wood use. The results also indicated that increases in emission reduction due to greater wood use compensated for 67.9 % of the decrease of carbon removal in 2050, for the rapid increase scenario. The results show that carbon removal in forests is most important in the short term because of the relative youth of the planted forests in Japan, and that mitigation effects by material and energy substitution may become greater over the longer term. © 2016, The Author(s).","Carbon removal; Emission reductions; Forest sector; Integrated model; Model projection","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Forestry; Wood; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon removal; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Forest sectors; Integrated modeling; Mitigation effects; Mitigation measures; Climate change; atmospheric modeling; carbon emission; climate change; complementarity; emission control; integrated approach; net ecosystem exchange; timber harvesting; trade-off; wood; Japan","Matsumoto, M.; Forestry and Forest Products Research Institute, Matsunosato, Japan; email: machan@ffpri.affrc.go.jp",,"Springer Tokyo",13416979,,JFREF,,"English","J.

To address this knowledge gap, research was conducted in Australia involving the analysis of several data sources, including interviews carried out with Australian federal government employees directly involved in the development of mitigation policies. The resulting case study determined that, in Australia, health co-benefits play a minimal role in the development of climate change mitigation policies. Several factors influence the extent to which health co-benefits inform the development of mitigation policies.

This analysis revealed how climate change deniers rely upon the concept of a regulatory cartel to connect economic opposition to climate policy with attacks on scientific evidence.

It produces 3930 (TW.h).a−1, and yields 16% of the world's generated electricity and about 78% of renewable electricity generation (in 2015). Hydropower and climate change show a double relationship. On the one hand, as an important renewable energy resource, hydropower contributes significantly to the avoidance of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and to the mitigation of global warming. On the other hand, climate change is likely to alter river discharge, impacting water availability and hydropower generation. Hydropower contributes significantly to the reduction of GHG emissions and to energy supply security. Compared with conventional coal power plants, hydropower prevents the emission of about 3 GT CO2 per year, which represents about 9% of global annual CO2 emissions. Hydropower projects may also have an enabling role beyond the electricity sector, as a financing instrument for multipurpose reservoirs and as an adaptive measure regarding the impacts of climate change on water resources, because regulated basins with large reservoir capacities are more resilient to water resource changes, less vulnerable to climate change, and act as a storage buffer against climate change. At the global level, the overall impact of climate change on existing hydropower generation may be expected to be small, or even slightly positive. However, there is the possibility of substantial variations across regions and even within countries. In conclusion, the general verdict on hydropower is that it is a cheap and mature technology that contributes significantly to climate change mitigation, and could play an important role in the climate change adaptation of water resource availability.

Through this research, we fill this relative gap using rural Nevada as a case study. In 2009/2010, we surveyed 1872 ranchers and farmers, investigating their climate change-related assumptions, experiences, knowledge bases, and policy preferences. Almost 26 % responded to our mail-based survey. We created a climate change vulnerability index as a function of physical vulnerability, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity and applied it for every respondent using demographic data from the survey and secondary Geographical Information System-based data on water availability and use, and population. In our research, we investigate the influence of vulnerability and its components on climate change mitigation policy support. The results show that vulnerability is an insignificant determinant of supporting climate change mitigation policies. Both physical vulnerability and adaptive capacity play no role in determining climate change mitigation policy support. However, sensitivity to climate change decreases support of stringent policies (i.e., taxation policies), but does not influence support of non-stringent policies (i.e., technological fixes). The most prominent determinants of climate change mitigation policy support are beliefs regarding the anthropogenic causes of climate change, beliefs regarding the causal relationship between drought and climate change in Nevada, and political orientations. © 2016, AESS.","Climate change policy support; Ranchers and farmers; Vulnerability","adaptive management; agricultural worker; anthropogenic effect; climate change; drought; environmental policy; GIS; management practice; perception; rural area; vulnerability; Nevada; United States","Safi, A.S.; Al Azhar UniversityEgypt; email: safi.ahmad74@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",21906483,,,,"English","J.

Such aspect becomes even more important under the future climate scenarios, in which global warming is expected. Based on that, the objectives of this study were to identify the impacts of raising temperatures on soybean yields in southern Brazil and how management strategies represented by changing sowing dates could be able to mitigate them. The soybean yields for the present and future scenarios were estimated by the crop simulation model CROPGRO-Soybean calibrated for southern Brazil. The simulations were done for 13 locations distributed in the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, considering climatic series of 31 years. The future climate scenarios were built based on downscaling temperature changes from ETA and PRECIS models for the periods: 2013–2043 (D25) and 2041–2071 (D55), without considering the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration. The soybean potential (Yp) and attainable (Ya) yields and their relationship (Ya/Yp) were estimated for all scenarios and used to determine the climatic risk for the crop. In order to investigate how to mitigate the global warming impacts on soybean yields, different sowing dates, two earlier and two later than the present recommendation, were simulated in the crop model and resulting yields were compared. In general, raising temperature will lead soybean crop in southern Brazil to lower yields, for both Yp and Ya, with higher impact on Ya, independently of the climate model used. Also, the climatic risk for the crop will increase in the future climates scenarios. The strategy of changing the sowing date showed to be feasible to reduce the impacts of raising temperatures on soybean yields, but only when it is delayed in relation to the sowing period presently recommended for this crop in the region. © 2015 Royal Meteorological Society","climate change; climatic risk; CSM-CROPGRO Soybean; Glycine max; sowing dates","Amino acids; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Global warming; Nitrogen fixation; Risk perception; Climate change impact; Climatic risks; Crop simulation model; Cropgro soybeans; Future climate scenarios; Global warming impact; Glycine max; Sowing date; Climate change; agricultural management; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; crop yield; global warming; risk factor; sowing date; soybean; Brazil; Parana [Brazil]; Rio Grande do Sul; Santa Catarina; Glycine max","Sentelhas, P.C.; Department of Biosystems Engineering, Brazil; email: pcsentel.esalq@usp.br",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",08998418,,IJCLE,,"English","Int.

The agricultural sector can however make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation through increasing or sustaining soil carbon levels. The perception and action of farmers to anticipated climate change may be a significant determinant of both climate change impacts and mitigation efforts in agriculture. This is the first national-scale study of the perception of climate change by farmers and their associated farming practices regarding mitigation and adaptation. We find that Danish farmers realise that climate change will affect them in the future, and that many are already affected and are taking action to prevent future losses. Almost one fourth of the farmers surveyed stated that they include climate change mitigation in soil management planning. The majority of Danish farmers are already adapting to the effects of climate change, especially through maintaining or expanding drainage areas to reduce the impact of heavy rain, but also by changing soil management practices to increase water infiltration capacity. The study reveals the paradoxical finding that farmers, although believing that climate change is real, and having experienced losses due to adverse climatic events, do not tend to connect the two phenomena. Also there seems to be no link between perceptions of climate change and adaptation/mitigation action. Knowledge gained from this study can be useful for future policymaking on the effect of farm management practices in relation to climate change. Acknowledging farmers’ attitudes and beliefs may be an important component in understanding the responsiveness of the agricultural sector to initiatives to reduce emissions from farming and to improve the robustness of agricultural systems to climate change. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Agriculture; Agronomy; Carbon; Soils; Agricultural sector; Agricultural system; Anthropogenic climate changes; Climate change impact; Climate change mitigation; Extreme weather events; Perception and actions; Soil management practices; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural management; agricultural practice; agricultural worker; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; farmers attitude; infiltration; perception; policy making; soil carbon; soil management; Denmark","Jørgensen, S.L.; The Danish AgriFish Agency, Nyropsgade 30, Denmark; email: silijo@naturerhverv.dk",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Nevertheless, focusing on some key systemic characteristics of cities can give useful insights for policy to advance health and well-being outcomes. Moreover, if we take a coevolutionary systems view of cities, some conventional assumptions about the nature of urban development (e.g. the growth in private vehicle use with income) may not stand up. We illustrate this by examining the coevolution of urban transport and land use systems, and institutional change, giving examples of policy implications. At a high level, our concern derives from the need to better understand the dynamics of urban change, and its implications for health and well-being. At a practical level, we see opportunities to use stylised findings about urban systems to underpin policy experiments. While it is now not uncommon to view cities as systems, policy makers appear to have made little use so far of a systems approach to inform choice of policies with consequences for health and well-being. System insights can be applied to intelligently anticipate change – for example, as cities are subjected to increasing natural system reactions to climate change, they must find ways to mitigate and adapt to it. Secondly, systems insights around policy cobenefits are vital for better informing horizontal policy integration. Lastly, an implication of system complexity is that rather than seeking detailed, ‘full’ knowledge about urban issues and policies, cities would be well advised to engage in policy experimentation to address increasingly urgent health and climate change issues. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cobenefits; Coevolution; Health; Mitigation; Transport; Urban system","Decision making; Health; Land use; Public policy; Urban growth; Urban transportation; Co-evolution; Cobenefits; Mitigation; Transport; Urban systems; Climate change; climate change; health care; land use; policy making; urban policy; urban system; urban transport; acclimatization; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; city; climate change; climate change mitigation; coevolution; ecosystem resilience; environmental protection; environmental sustainability; health; health impact assessment; housing; land use; nesting; policy; priority journal; traffic and transport; urbanization; wellbeing; human; management; public policy; urban health; Cities; Climate Change; Humans; Policy Making; Public Policy; Urban Health","Chapman, R.; School of Geography, Kelburn Parade, New Zealand; email: ralph.chapman@vuw.ac.nz",,"Elsevier Ltd",01604120,,ENVID,"27126780","English","Environ.

This suggests that middle-income countries may reach a tipping point in their development process where low-carbon investment becomes more viable. In order to avoid dangerous levels of climate change, this tipping point needs to be brought forward in time: upper-middle-income countries are already responsible for 37.8% of global CO2 emissions. We explore the scope for large-scale investment in climate mitigation in Johor Bahru, a fast-growing industrial city in Malaysia. We find that the city could reduce per capita emissions by 10.0% by 2025, relative to 2014 levels, through cost-effective investments. If the returns could be recovered and reinvested in low-carbon measures, Johor Bahru could reduce per capita emissions by 35.2% by 2025, relative to 2014 levels. This result suggests that the tipping point may be a function of political will and institutional capacity as well as income. This has substantial implications for global climate policy discussions, particularly the opportunities and responsibilities of middle-income countries. If comparable savings can be delivered across cities in middle-income countries, this would equate to a reduction in global emissions of 6.3% with the exploitation of cost-effective options and 11.3% with the exploitation of cost-neutral options. Investing in economically attractive low-carbon measures could also provide cities in middle-income countries with an opportunity to build the political momentum and institutional capacities necessary for deeper decarbonization. © 2015 The Author(s).

This work presents a generic methodological framework to plan, manage and implement climate change mitigation and adaptation measures in the tourism context. The methodological scheme is based on Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis for prioritizing available options applicable to a defined tourism area. The proposed framework is implemented for Greece, one of the world's most popular tourism destinations, and optimally ranks 18 mitigation and 16 adaptation measures under 4 criteria i.e. environmental benefit, applicability, cost and social acceptance.

This article reflects the potential use of biochar in agriculture from the perspective of the farming economy. Biochar soil amendment in crop production is regarded as a win–win situation, both for assumed increases in cropping yields and carbon sequestration in soil organic matter. However, an extensive review on biochar effect on crop yield has not yet been able to provide compelling arguments to foster more widespread biochar use in cropping systems. Furthermore, the half-lives of biochars are frequently shorter than commonly suggested, and other financial incentives, such as including biochar in carbon credit systems, are not in place to compensate for the extra cost of applying biochar. As a result, we conclude with a somewhat skeptical view for a widespread use of biochar in agriculture in the near future. © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","abatement costs; biochar; crop yield; rentability; stability","Carbon; Convergence of numerical methods; Crops; Cultivation; Forestry; Soils; Waste management; Abatement costs; Bio chars; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Crop yield; Financial incentives; rentability; Soil organic matters; Climate change","Bach, M.; Institute for Landscape Ecology and Resources Management, Germany; email: martin.bach@umwelt.uni-giessen.de",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",17583004,,,,"English","Carbon Manage.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84981169947

The aim of this study is to assess the effects on health and well-being of GHG emissions reduction policies in the city of Geneva. Three projects related to climate change mitigation were identified, in three topic areas: urban planning, heating and transport. These projects are: a complex urbanisation plan in a neighbourhood of the city of Geneva (urban planning and heating), a sustainable transportation plan for a district in Geneva (transport) and a strategy to encourage City's employees to use sustainable mobility for local business travel (transport). The main issues investigated were physical activity, air quality, noise and energy. The methodological approach consisted in applying the Health Impact Assessment process. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used to assess potential health impacts. For the first project, results show that the energy scenario with the least CO2 emissions is the best for limiting health impacts (and maximising cobenefits). For the second project, results show that the scenario with the most space devolved to pedestrians is the most beneficial for health especially in terms of cardiovascular disease prevention. The analysis of the strategy of the City of Geneva for local business travel revealed that the strengthening of sustainable modes of transportation for this purpose in the city would be favourable in terms of the environment (reduction of CO2, NOx and PM10 emissions) and health. It appears from this case-study in Geneva that cities can play a key role in tackling climate change while bringing co-benefits for health.

High rates of urban sprawl need to be reduced by increased inner-urban development while settlements have to adapt to climate change and contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions at the same time. In this study, we analyze conflicts in the management of urban areas and develop integrated sustainable land use strategies for Germany. The spatial explicit land use change model Land Use Scanner is used to simulate alternative scenarios of land use change for Germany for 2030. A multi-criteria analysis is set up based on these scenarios and based on a set of indicators. They are used to measure whether the mitigation and adaptation objectives can be achieved and to uncover conflicts between these aims. The results show that the built-up and transport area development can be influenced both in terms of magnitude and spatial distribution to contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation. Strengthening the inner-urban development is particularly effective in terms of reducing built-up and transport area development. It is possible to reduce built-up and transport area development to approximately 30 ha per day in 2030, which matches the sustainability objective of the German Federal Government for the year 2020. In the case of adaptation to climate change, the inclusion of extreme flood events in the context of spatial planning requirements may contribute to a reduction of the damage potential. © 2016 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Adaptation; Germany; Land Use Scanner; Mitigation; Scenario; Urban growth",,"Hoymann, J.; Federal Institute for Research on Building, Deichmanns Aue 31-37, Germany; email: jana.hoymann@bbr.bund.de",,"MDPI AG",22209964,,,,"English","ISPRS Int.

Storage of CO2 under the seabed moves this climate mitigation option away from inhabited areas and could thereby take away some of the opposition towards this technology. Given that in the event of CO2 leakage through the overburden in the case of sub-seabed CCS, the ocean could function as buffer for receiving this greenhouse gas, instead of it directly being emitted into the atmosphere, offshore CCS could also address concerns over the climatic impacts of CO2 seepage. We point out that recent geological studies provide evidence that to date CO2 has been safely stored under the seabed. Leakage for individual offshore CCS operations could thus be unlikely from a technical point of view, if storage sites are well chosen, well managed and well monitored. But we argue that on a global longterm scale, for an ensemble of thousands or millions of storage sites, leakage of CO2 could take place in certain cases and/or countries for e.g. economic, institutional, legal or safety-cultural reasons. In this paper we investigate what the impact could be in terms of temperature increase and ocean acidification if leakage occurs at a global level, and address the question what the relative roles could be of on- and offshore CCS if mankind desires to divert the damages resulting from climate change. For this purpose, we constructed a top-down energy-environment-economy model, with which we performed a probabilistic Monte-Carlo cost-benefit analysis of climate change mitigation with on- and offshore CCS as specific CO2 abatement options. One of our main conclusions is that, even under conditions with non-zero (permille/year) leakage for CCS activity globally, both onshore and offshore CCS should probably – on economic grounds at least - still account for anywhere between 20 % and 80 % of all future CO2 abatement efforts under a broad range of CCS cost assumptions. © 2016, The Author(s).","Climate change; Cost-benefit analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; Ocean acidification; Onshore versus offshore CCS","Acidification; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Monte Carlo methods; Oceanography; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Climate change mitigation; Climate mitigations; Geological reservoirs; Monte carlo analysis; Ocean acidifications; Onshore versus offshore CCS; Probabilistic costs; Temperature increase; Climate change; acidification; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; cost-benefit analysis; environmental economics; environmental impact; geological structure; greenhouse gas; health impact; mitigation; Monte Carlo analysis; oceanography; probability; reservoir; seafloor; seepage","van der Zwaan, B.; Energy research Centre of the Netherlands (ECN), Netherlands; email: vanderzwaan@ecn.nl",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Considering that individual climate change efforts are unlikely to affect global mitigation paths, the study investigates the possibility that sectoral approaches can help in the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, using Thailand as a case study. It conducted online questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews to acquire primary data from companies and key informants from the government, NGOs, NPOs and academics. The results suggested that, among three possible groups of factors that could affect company decisions on whether to promote sectoral approaches, domestic politics (particularly the Thai government) is the most important, though other factors also play important and interrelated roles.

With population growth and the need to significantly increase agricultural production per unit of area during the 21st century, a changing climate will put additional stress on soil resources. Soil and water conservation will be key for the future of humanity. Professional societies in the area of agriculture and soil and water conservation have recognized the importance that soil resources will have for humanity during this century and have made calls for implementation of worldwide soil and water conservation. For example, in 2010 the Soil and Water Conservation Society (SWCS) invited a group of scientists to review the literature about the potential to use conservation practices for climate change adaptation and mitigation. The Delgado et al. (2011) paper was used by the SWCS to develop and adopt a position statement about the importance of using soil and water conservation practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The International Soil Conservation Organization (ISCO) invited the lead author to present the paper as a keynote presentation at the ISCO 2013 conference. The European Society of Soil Conservation (ESSC) published a short communication about this paper in one of their newsletters in 2014. The World Association of Soil and Water Conservation (WASWAC) also invited the lead author to present a keynote presentation on this topic at the 2015 WASWAC annual meeting in Nanchang. This paper (the Nanchang Communication) is a summary of the Delgado et al. (2011) paper that was used by the SWCS to develop the SWCS position statement related to soil and water conservation and climate change. The Nanchang Communication (this paper) was used by WASWAC to develop a position statement about the immediate need for implementation of conservation practices for mitigation of and adaptation to climate change to achieve food security in the 21st century. These papers (Delgado et al., 2011, Nanchang Communication), and the SWCS and WASWAC position statements, support the conclusions from the worldwide literature that without implementation of soil and water conservation practices for climate change mitigation and adaptation, the survival of life, including our own species, will be in jeopardy, since soils will be key to meeting the higher demands for food during the 21st century. © 2016 International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press","Climate change; Conservation practice; Food security; SWCS; WASWAC",,"Delgado, J.A.; Soil Management and Sugar Beet Research Unit, 2150 Centre Ave., Building D, Suite 100, United States; email: jorge.delgado@ars.usda.gov",,"International Research and Training Center on Erosion and Sedimentation and China Water and Power Press",20956339,,,,"English","Int.

First, society’s response to possible future climate change is subject to many uncertainties. Second, we argue that society’s mitigation action emerge out of the actions and interactions of the many actors in society. Together, these two factors imply that the overarching dynamics of society’s response to climate change are unpredictable. In contrast to conventional processes of developing scenarios, in this study the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society has been represented in an agent-based model with which we developed two narratives of the emergence of climate change mitigation action by applying exploratory modelling and analysis. The agent-based model represents a two-level game involving governments and citizens changing their emission behaviour in the face of climate change through mitigation action. Insights gained from the exploration on uncertainties pertaining to the system have been used to construct two internally consistent and plausible narratives on the pathways of the emergence of mitigation action, which, as we argue, are a reasonable summary of the uncertainty space. The first narrative highlights how and when strong mitigation action emerges while the second narrative highlights how and when weak mitigation action emerges. In contrast to a conventional scenario development process, these two scenarios have been discovered bottom up rather than being defined top down. They succinctly capture the possible outcomes of the emergence of climate change mitigation by society across a large range of uncertain factors. The narratives therefore help in conveying the consequences of the various uncertainties influencing the emergence of climate change mitigation action by society. © 2016, University of Surrey.

Advancements in technology, infrastructure, and industry have been made possible by the use of fossil fuels. In recent decades, recognition of climate change and its causes has increased, coinciding with other, sector-wide transitions in energy generation and use. The interconnected nature of climate and energy issues calls for legal and regulatory frameworks that are better able to integrate these two concerns— effective broad-scale policy on climate must engage with the complex system for regulating energy, and forward-thinking changes in energy policy must address climate externalities on present and future generations. This article examines Mexico’s experience in its efforts to bridge these two policy areas. Since 2012, Mexico has pursued two parallel tracks in policy developments: the enactment of comprehensive legislation on climate change, and constitutional changes related to energy—specifically, the generation of electricity. In 2013, Mexico amended its Constitution to allow for competition in electricity generation, and legislation enacted in 2014 and 2015 have called for rapid restructuring of the country’s electricity sector and the creation of a new wholesale energy market. At the same time, Mexico’s General Climate Change Act of 2012 establishes ambitious goals for greenhouse gas reduction, including a transition to greater use of “clean energy.” The constitutional reform provides a significant opportunity—if appropriately leveraged—for Mexico to make policy changes that will enable the country to play a leadership role in integrating climate mitigation and energy regulation. © 2016, University of New Mexico.

It examines how seed corn contracts in Michigan constrain the choices of farmers and allow farmers to rationalize the over-application of fertilizer and associated water pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Seed corn contracts use a competitive “tournament” system where farmers are rewarded for maximizing yields. Interviews and a focus group were used to understand fertilizer over-application and barriers to participating in a climate change mitigation program. Results indicate that farmers agree that they over-apply fertilizer but would be unlikely to participate in a mitigation program due to their contracts and lack of support from seed corn companies. Because only a few companies control access to the seed corn market, farmers feel they have few choices. Farmers rationalized their practices as their only option given the competitive nature of their contracts and blamed other sources of pollution. Despite increasing efforts to educate farmers about climate change, structural barriers will continue to constrain participation in mitigation efforts and the development of a climate change ethic. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Consolidation; Environment; Ethics; Fertilizer; Seed corn","agricultural development; agricultural practice; climate change; ethics; fertilizer application; maize; mitigation; seed; Michigan; United States; Zea mays","Stuart, D.; Sustainable Communities Program and School of Earth Sciences and Environmental Sustainability, 19 W.

Despite concerns that communicating adaptation could undermine public support for mitigation, previous research has found it can have the opposite effect by increasing risk salience. It is also unclear whether people respond differently to information about mitigation and adaptation depending on whether action is framed as an individual or government responsibility. Using an experimental design, this study sought to examine how public attitudes towards mitigation are influenced by varying climate change messages, and how this might interact with prior attitudes to climate change. UK-based participants (N = 800) read one of four texts in a 2 × 2 design comparing adaptation versus mitigation information and personal versus governmental action. No main effect was found for adaptation versus mitigation framing, nor for individual action versus government policy, but we did observe a series of interaction effects with prior attitudes to climate change. Mitigation and adaptation information affected participants’ responses differently depending on their pre-existing levels of concern about climate change, suggesting that mitigation framings may be more engaging for those with high levels of concern, whereas adaptation framings may be more engaging for low-concern individuals. Government mitigation action appears to engender particularly polarised attitudes according to prior concern.

The foremost objective of the present research is to estimate the chemical weathering rate (CWR) of the continental water in the entire stretch of Brahmaputra River from upstream to downstream and their associated CO2 consumption rate. To establish the link between the rapid chemical weathering and thereby enhance CO2 drawdown from the atmosphere, the major ion composition of the Brahmaputra River that drains the Himalaya has been obtained. Major ion chemistry of the Brahmaputra River was resolved on samples collected from nine locations in pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon seasons for two cycles: cycle I (2011–2012) and cycle II (2013–2014). The physico-chemical parameters of water samples were analysed by employing standard methods. The Brahmaputra River was characterized by alkalinity, high concentration of Ca2+ and HCO3 − along with significant temporal variation in major ion composition. In general, it was found that water chemistry of the river was mainly controlled by rock weathering with minor contributions from atmospheric and anthropogenic sources. The effective CO2 pressure (logPCO2) for pre-monsoon, monsoon and post-monsoon has been estimated. The question of rates of chemical weathering (carbonate and silicate) was addressed by using TDS and run-off (mm year−1). It has been found that the extent of CWR is directly dependent on the CO2 consumption rate which may be further evaluated from the perspective of climate change mitigation The average annual CO2 consumption rate of the Brahmaputra River due to silicate and carbonate weathering was found to be 0.52 (×106 mol Km−2 year−1) and 0.55 (×106 mol Km−2 year−1) for cycle I and 0.49 (×106 mol Km−2 year−1) and 0.52 (×106 mol Km−2 year−1) for cycle II, respectively, which were significantly higher than that of other Himalayan rivers. Estimation of CWR of the Brahmaputra River indicates that carbonate weathering largely dominates the water chemistry of the Brahmaputra River. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.","Brahmaputra River; Climate change; CO2 consumption rate; Water chemistry; Weathering","carbon dioxide; chemical weathering; climate change; cyclicity; river water; water chemistry; Brahmaputra River; Himalayas; India","Kumar, M.; Department of Environmental Science, India; email: manish.env@gmail.com",,"Springer Netherlands",13806165,,,,"English","Aquatic Geochem.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964334253

The climate and ageing factors were modelled individually and then integrated together for several decades. Results from the climate-only simulation showed a decrease in the building heating energy usage which outweighed the increase in the on-site cooling energy demand occurring in a warming scenario. The study revealed a high sensitivity of energy performance to building ageing, in particular due to HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning) equipment efficiency degradation. Building ageing was seen to negatively affect the energy performance as it induced a further increase of the cooling energy usage in a warming climate, while it also counteracted the reduction of the heating energy usage resulting from warming. Simulations on the combination of mitigation techniques showed a number of potentially retrofit measures that would be beneficial for buildings to avoid an increase in the cooling energy usage due to climate warming. The combination of these retrofit techniques showed a potential decrease of 87.3% in the final cooling energy usage for the considered building. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.","Building ageing; Building modelling; Climate change; Degradation; Efficiency; Energy performance; IDA ICE simulations; Mitigation","Air conditioning; Buildings; Degradation; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Retrofitting; Building energy performance; Building modelling; Energy performance; Equipment efficiency; Ice simulation; Mitigation; Mitigation techniques; Ventilation and air conditioning; Climate change; building; climate change; climate effect; computer simulation; energy efficiency; energy use; environmental degradation; global warming; modeling; performance assessment; Italy; Piedmont [Italy]; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin","Fuentes, E.; Catalonia Institute for Energy Research, Spain; email: efuentes@irec.cat",,"Elsevier Ltd",03601323,,BUEND,,"English","Build.

The threat of altered environments and possibility of mass migrations of people have spurred intensive planning as well as the commitment of considerable resources to addressing such threats. Indeed, the primacy of climate change adaptation and mitigation efforts and planning has become so pronounced that one might argue that this is a new and pre-eminent form of development in the international arena. As with previous developmental preoccupations such as progress, modernity, gender, microcredit, participation and good governance, climate change adaptation and mitigation is today a central part of the development mantra. In this paper I examine the 'climate change turn' in development work by focusing on the case of Bangladesh, a country often discussed in both scholarly literature and popular discourse as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the possible effects of climate change. Images of rising waters, flooded fields and displaced farmers in the region have become an iconic symbol deployed during debates on climate change both locally and globally. As a result Bangladesh has emerged as a laboratory of sorts in which a series of national-level strategic plans, projects, programmes, trust funds and financing schemes are being designed and tested in partnership with international donors and development agencies, all built around the idea of climate change and resilience. Looking specifically at some of the most marginalised communities in Bangladesh - such as char dwellers and slum populations - I question in this paper what impact these efforts to combat climate change may have, in particular the possibility of being displaced not by climate change but rather by development processes meant to ameliorate its effects. © 2016 Royal Geographical Society (with the Institute of British Geographers).","Adaptation/mitigation; Bangladesh; Climate change; Environmental displacement","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; environmental planning; environmental policy; policy approach; strategic approach; vulnerability; Bangladesh","Bose, P.S.; Department of Geography, United States; email: pbose@uvm.edu",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",00040894,,,,"English","Area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84921476701

Fossil fuels can be substituted by using wood products in place of alternative materials and energy, but wood harvesting reduces forest carbon sink and processing of wood products requires material and energy inputs. We assessed the extended life cycle carbon emissions considering substitution impacts for various wood utilization scenarios over 100 years from 2010 onward for Finland. The scenarios were based on various but constant wood utilization structures reflecting current and anticipated mix of wood utilization activities. We applied stochastic simulation to deal with the uncertainty in a number of input variables required. According to our analysis, the wood utilization decrease net carbon emissions with a probability lower than 40% for each of the studied scenarios. Furthermore, large emission reductions were exceptionally unlikely. The uncertainty of the results were influenced clearly the most by the reduction in the forest carbon sink. There is a significant trade-off between avoiding emissions through fossil fuel substitution and reduction in forest carbon sink due to wood harvesting. This creates a major challenge for forest management practices and wood utilization activities in responding to ambitious climate change mitigation targets. © 2016 American Chemical Society.",,"Economic and social effects; Emission control; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Life cycle; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Wood; Wood fuels; Wood products; Alternative materials; Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Emission reduction; Forest carbon sinks; Forest management practices; Fuel substitution; Stochastic simulations; Climate change; carbon; fossil fuel; carbon emission; carbon sink; climate change; emission control; forest management; fossil fuel; life cycle analysis; management practice; timber harvesting; trade-off; wood; Article; carbon sink; climate change; Finland; forest management; harvesting; reduction; simulation; stochastic model; substitution reaction; wood; biomass; chemistry; forest; wood; Biomass; Forest Management; Forests; Fossil Fuels; Seasonal Variation; Finland; Biomass; Climate Change; Finland; Forests; Wood","Soimakallio, S.; Finnish Environment InstituteFinland; email: sampo.soimakallio@ymparisto.fi",,"American Chemical Society",0013936X,,ESTHA,"27074531","English","Environ.

Based on detailed case studies of three Asian cities, this paper finds that the adoption of low emission development strategies (LEDS) at the urban level could be economically attractive. However, it also argues that without a coordinated multi-level, cross-sectoral governance framework these opportunities for low carbon urban development are likely to be left unexploited. As these governance conditions are frequently not in place, we argue that these case study cities, and cities in similar contexts, are likely to miss even the economically attractive low carbon development opportunities and become increasingly locked in to higher cost, higher carbon development paths. Due to their growing size and importance, we conclude that the presence or absence of governance arrangements that enable the adoption of low carbon development strategies in Asian cities will have global implications for climate change. © 2015 The Authors.","Asia; Carbon; Cities; Climate; Governance; Mitigation","carbon emission; climate change; developing world; governance approach; strategic approach; urban development; Asia","Gouldson, A.; School of Earth and Environment, Woodhouse Lane, United Kingdom; email: a.gouldson@leeds.ac.uk",,"Elsevier Ltd",02642751,,,,"English","Cities",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Hybrid Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84962339314

As a way of responding to both adaptation and mitigation challenges within the industry, this article examines how community-based climate change adaptation initiatives might provide mitigation outcomes in the agriculture sector in Timor-Leste. Beginning with an exploration of nation-wide institutional responses to climate change, the study utilises interviews, field observations and document analysis to examine an extensive community-based adaptation program in two districts in Timor-Leste focused on increasing the resilience of the agriculture sector and the livelihoods of poor rural farmers. Analysis of this program reveals a largely synergistic relationship between adaptation measures focused on land and water management and agriculture and their corresponding greenhouse gas mitigation potential, including co-benefits such as soil/atmospheric carbon sequestration, reduced emissions, soil nitrification and reduced use of inorganic fertilisers. Community-based adaptation programs in the agriculture sector have a significant influence on mitigation outcomes, which is often overlooked in community-based programs.

Scenarios of EU and global climate action to 2050 are quantified using the GEME3-RD model, a global multi-sectoral computable general equilibrium model with endogenous technology progress and detailed representation of the clean energy technologies. The model includes two-factor learning curves (stock and research and development funding) for clean energy technologies, such as electric vehicles, carbon capture and storage, and renewable and efficient appliances. Funding of research and development is endogenously derived as a production factor enabling productivity improvement. The scenarios compare stylised climate strategies, which are asymmetric by world region and have different emission reduction profiles over time. Assuming that strong climate mitigation action will be undertaken only after 2030, the scenarios compare two main strategies for the EU: pursuing strong emission reduction unilaterally until 2030 versus deferring action for the period after 2030. Asymmetric climate action by region enables asymmetric innovation and manufacturing of clean energy technologies. The macroeconomic assessment of the climate action strategies does not only depend on costs of clean technologies but also on induced technology progress implying asymmetric effects on manufacturing and trade by region, taking into account spillovers. The model-based projections show clear advantages for the EU as a first mover in climate change mitigation compared with a delaying of climate action until 2030. Delayed climate action until 2030 implies higher gross domestic product losses for the EU compared with unilateral action until 2030. The model finds benefits of early action by the EU driven by activity and progress related to clean energy technologies as the EU can achieve competitive advantages over other world regions pursuing climate action later. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium modelling; Economic growth induced by technology progress; Macroeconomic assessment of clean energy technologies","Carbon capture; Climate models; Competition; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Engineering education; Manufacture; Productivity; Clean energy technology; Climate change mitigation; Computable general equilibrium; Computable general equilibrium model; Gross domestic products; Productivity improvements; Research and development; Technology progress; Climate change","Tsani, S.; E3M Lab, 9 Iroon Politechniou Street, Greece; email: stellatsani@gmail.com",,"John Wiley and Sons Ltd",0363907X,,IJERD,,"English","Int.

Resource markets, in particular the oil market, are characterized by a large discrepancy between costs of resource extraction and commodity prices on international markets. We explain this observation in terms of (a) the intertemporal scarcity rent, (b) regional price differentials arising from trade and transport costs, (c) heterogeneity and inertia in the extraction sector. These effects are captured by the REMIND model. We use the model to explore economic effects of changes in coal, oil and gas markets induced by climate-change mitigation policies. A large share of fossil fuel reserves and resources will be used in the absence of climate policy leading to atmospheric GHG concentrations well beyond a level of 550 ppm CO2-eq. This result holds independently of different assumptions about energy demand and fossil fuel availability. Achieving ambitious climate targets will drastically reduce fossil fuel consumption, in particular the consumption of coal. Conventional oil and gas as well as non-conventional oil reserves are still exhausted. We find the net present value of fossil fuel rent until 2100 at 30tril.US$ with a large share of oil and a small share of coal. This is reduced by 9 and 12tril.US$ to achieve climate stabilization at 550 and 450 ppm CO2-eq, respectively. This loss is, however, overcompensated by revenues from carbon pricing that are 21 and 32tril.US$, respectively. The overcompensation also holds under variations of energy demand and fossil fuel supply. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Coal; Commerce; Costs; Economics; Energy management; Extraction; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Petroleum deposits; Power markets; Proven reserves; Climate change mitigation; Climate stabilization; Conventional oil and gas; Fossil fuel resources; Fossil resources; International markets; Net present value; Resource extraction; Climate change","Bauer, N.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PO Box 601203, Germany; email: Nico.Bauer@pik-potsdam.de",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

Difficulties in representing the system with an economic model have been overcome by representing the energy system with a technical-economic growth model (MARKAL-TIMES) based on the stock of existing plants, transformation processes, and end-use devices. GHG emission scenarios depend mainly on the pace of transition in Kazakhstan from a planned economy to a market economy. Three scenarios are portrayed: an incomplete transition, a fast and successful one, and even more advanced participation in global climate change mitigation, including participation in some emission trading schemes. If the transition to a market economy is completed by 2020, P&amp;M already adopted may reduce emissions of CO2 from combustion by about 85 MtCO2 by 2030 – 17% of the emissions in the baseline (WOM) scenario. One-third of these reductions are likely to be obtained from the demand sectors, and two-thirds from the supply sectors. If every tonne of CO2 not emitted is valued up to US$10 in 2020 and $20 in 2030, additional P&amp;M may further reduce emissions by 110 MtCO2 by 2030. Policy relevance: This article analyses Kazakhstan’s climate change and energy efficiency policies by making use of a modelling platform that provides a consistent framework for testing dynamic hypotheses. The effects of different P&amp;M have been evaluated as he differences between two scenarios according to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting guidelines. It concludes that domestic climate mitigation objectives are synergistic with energy efficiency goals, and the set of policies adopted to achieve both objectives should be planned, implemented, and enforced jointly. It also quantifies the GHG emissions reduction if the transition to a market economy proceeds quickly and successfully (~ - 100 MtCO2e in 2030), and if a mitigation-specific policy is implemented (~ - 200 MtCO2e in 2030) compared to a baseline projection, and it highlights the need to prepare more robust and detailed energy balances and inventory of emissions in order to develop and monitor the progress of the policies © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","bottom-up approaches; climate change policies; emission projections; emissions scenarios; energy models; optimal emissions path","bottom-up approach; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; emission inventory; energy balance; environmental economics; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Kazakhstan","Kerimray, A.; Nazarbayev University Research and Innovation System, 53 Kabanbay Batyr Avenue, Kazakhstan; email: aiymgul.kerimray@nu.edu.kz",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

Economic structure adjustment has played and is expected to continue to play important role for carbon mitigation. Development of nuclear and renewable power would contribute to around 2 billion tons and 3.7 billion tons carbon reductions by 2020 and 2030 respectively. Key energy saving and low carbon technologies in the end-use sectors such as industry, transportation and building are listed and assessed. The mitigation potential and cost curve for steel is provided as an example to show that a large amount of carbon emissions could be reduced with minus mitigation cost partly resulting to energy saved. For industry process, carbon mitigation potentials would be around 420 million tons and 770 million tons by 2020 and 2030 respectively. Carbon mitigation potentials from LULUCF (Land use, land use change and forestry) are still uncertain and needed further research. For the assessment of 45% carbon intensity reduction target in 2020, it is concluded that economic structure adjustment, energy efficiency improvement, development of non-fossil energy, building and transportation would contribute to 33.4%, 28.5%, 20.4% and 17.3% of the total reductions. Assuming GDP growth rate as 6%-7% during 2010-2030, energy intensity reduction rate as 15% during 2015-2020, 14% during 2020-2025, and 13% during 2025-2030, the total primary energy consumption would be around 6 billion tons. To control coal use to less than 50% of the total primary energy consumption, while increasing the share of nature gas to over 10%, and the share of new and renewable energy to 20% or higher, carbon emissions would peak around 2030 at 11 to 12 billion tons. Finally, Climate change mitigation strategies to facilitate the achievement of China's carbon emission peak target are proposed. It's also suggested that measures are needed to accelerate the economy restructuring and development modes shift, to control the growth rate of total energy demand, to maintain a sustainable energy system with the new and renewable energy as its main components, and to achieve the carbon emission peak target by sector and region. © 2016, Science Press.

In this paper, we argue that important contextual factors are the ones that are perceived to have a great impact over policy effectiveness by key related actors. By examining more thoroughly those effects over PIs, as perceived by policy and market actors, useful feedback on observed policy adaptations can be highlighted. In this context, the aim of this paper is to present a conceptual framework which seeks to investigate the impact of key external factors on policy decision-making. This framework is then applied to policies intended to foster sustainability in the Greek building sector. Contextual parameters that are influential over the effectiveness of the national energy conservation measures are identified through a stakeholder survey. Cluster analysis is then employed for the elicitation of three distinct decision-making priorities' scenarios. General macroeconomic trends, energy costs, characteristics of the building sector and socio-institutional factors are prioritized differently from various types of actors and induce certain types of PI changes. Distinguishing among the different types of PI change can help explain better under which contextual circumstances policy adaptations occur and provide guidance to other policy makers when found in similar decisional contexts. © 2016 by the authors.","Building sector; Cluster analysis; Contextual factors; Energy efficiency policy instruments; Policy instrument change","Cluster analysis; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Building sectors; Climate change mitigation; Conceptual frameworks; Contextual factors; Energy conservation measures; Energy efficiency policies; Institutional factors; Policy instruments; Climate change","Flamos, A.; Department of Industrial Management and Technology, Karaoli and Dimitriou 80, Greece; email: aflamos@unipi.gr",,"MDPI AG",19961073,,,,"English","Energies",Article,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84964453371

Methodology: We used a bio-economic model of the French Forest Sector (FFSM++) that is able to consider and integrate: (a) the effects of climate change over forest dynamics; (b) forest investment decisions (among groups of species) according to expected profitability; and (c) market effects in terms of regionalised supply, consumption and trade of HWP, depending on the forest resource stocks and international prices. By including both forest dynamics and forest products, we can evaluate the carbon balance taking the following elements into consideration: (a) carbon sequestered in live and dead biomass in the forest; (b) carbon sequestered in HWP; (c) carbon substituted when wood is used in place of fossil fuels or more energy-intensive materials; and (d) carbon released by forest operations. Results: When the model is run at constant conditions for the next century, the average carbon potential of French forests is 66.2-125.3 Mt CO2 y-1, depending on whether we consider only inventoried wood resources, HWP pools and direct energy substitution, or if we also account for the carbon stored in tree branches and roots and if we consider the more indirect, but also largely more subjective, material substitution. These values correspond to 18.3% and 34.7%, respectively, of the French 2010 emissions (361 Mt CO2). However, when we consider both the probable increment of coniferous mortality and changes in forest growth, plus the rise in HWP demand worldwide, the average sequestration rate of the French forest decreases by 6.6-5.8% to 61.8-118.0 Mt CO2 y-1. Running partial scenarios, we can assess the relative interplay of these two factors, where the price factor increases the HWP stock while decreasing the forest stocks (where the latter effect prevails), while the physical impact of climate change reduces both, but to a lesser extent. Considering short-sighted forest managers, whose behaviour is based uniquely on the observed conditions at the time decisions are made, we obtain a limited effect of the overall carbon balance but a relatively large impact on the area allocation of broadleaved vs. coniferous species. © 2015 Department of Forest Economics, SLU Umeå, Sweden.","Bio-economic model; Carbon balance; Climate change; Forest sector","Climate change; Climate models; Commerce; Economics; Fossil fuels; Investments; Managers; Population statistics; Uncertainty analysis; Wood; Wood fuels; Wood products; Bio-economic model; Carbon balance; Carbon sequestration; Coniferous species; Constant conditions; Forest sectors; Harvested wood products; Material substitutions; Forestry; adaptive management; carbon balance; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; emission control; emissions trading; forest dynamics; forest management; resource allocation; France","Lobianco, A.; AgroParisTech, France; email: antonello.lobianco@agroparistech.fr",,"Elsevier GmbH",11046899,,,,"English","J.

It is also claimed to mitigate climate change through soil carbon sequestration: we conducted a meta-analysis of soil organic carbon (SOC) stock changes under CA practices in two tropical regions, the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), to quantify this. In IGP annual increases in SOC stock compared to conventional practice were between 0.16 and 0.49MgCha-1yr-1. In SSA increases were between 0.28 and 0.96MgCha-1yr-1, but with much greater variation and a significant number of cases with no measurable increase. Most reported SOC stock increases under CA are overestimates because of errors introduced by inappropriate soil sampling methodology. SOC increases require careful interpretation to assess whether or not they represent genuine climate change mitigation as opposed to redistribution of organic C within the landscape or soil profile. In smallholder farming in tropical regions social and economic barriers can greatly limit adoption of CA, further decreasing realistic mitigation potential. Comparison with the decreases in greenhouse gas emissions possible through improved management of nitrogen (N) fertilizer in regions such as IGP where N use is already high, suggests that this is a more effective and sustainable means of mitigating climate change. However the mitigation potential, and other benefits, from crop diversification are frequently overlooked when considering CA and warrant greater attention. Increases in SOC concentration (as opposed to stock) in near-surface soil from CA cause improvements in soil physical conditions; these are expected to contribute to increased sustainability and climate change adaptation, though not necessarily leading to consistently increased crop yields. CA should be promoted on the basis of these factors and any climate change mitigation regarded as an additional benefit, not a major policy driver for its adoption. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Conservation agriculture; Crop diversification; Crop residues; Nitrogen; Soil organic carbon; Tropical; Zero-tillage",,"Powlson, D.S.; Department of Sustainable Soils and Grassland Systems, United Kingdom; email: david.powlson@rothamsted.ac.uk",,"Elsevier",01678809,,AEEND,,"English","Agric.

The traditional practice of open burning of residues (System A) was compared with the alternative of converting residues to biochar, which was returned to the same land area from which the residues were obtained (System B). Pyrolytic cook-stoves and drum ovens were assumed to be used by households to produce biochar, and the cook-stoves produced heat energy for cooking. The annual rate of biochar applied was determined by the amount of biochar produced from the straw and husk available. We assumed that agronomic effects of biochar increased with each annual biochar application until reaching maximum benefits at 18 Mg ha-1 , which takes eight years to be produced in pyrolytic cook-stoves and drum ovens. The largest contributor to the carbon footprint of rice at the mill gate, was CH4 emissions from soil, in both systems. Biochar addition reduced the carbon footprint of spring rice and summer rice by 26% and 14% respectively, compared with System A, in the first year of application. These values substantially increased to 49% and 38% after eight years of biochar addition. The climate effect of System B was most sensitive to the assumed suppression of soil CH4 emissions due to biochar application. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon footprint; Life Cycle Assessment; Methane emissions; Pyrolytic cook-stove; Rice residues","Carbon footprint; Heating; Life cycle; Ovens; Stoves; Climate change mitigation; Cook stove; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Methane emissions; Residue management; Rice cropping systems; Rice production systems; Rice residues; Climate change","Mohammadi, A.; School of Environmental and Rural Science, Australia; email: Ali.Mohammadi@une.edu.au",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

Specifically, the environmental pressures stemming from economic activities have never been analysed in lines with the principles of production economics. This paper, therefore, aims to estimate the environmental performance index (EPI) for Lithuanian economic sectors. The paper presents the underlying trends in greenhouse gas emissions in Lithuania. The environmental performance index is estimated by employing the data envelopment analysis in the spirit of the Hicks-Moorsteen indices. The present analysis is based on the data from the World Input-Output Database. Specifically, the environmental technology is defined in terms of the value added, carbon and nitrous oxide emissions, labour, capital and energy. Results of the analysis imply that the analysed economic sectors can be grouped into the four clusters with respect to the mean EPI and its rate of growth. Pulp, paper and agricultural sectors fall into the best-performing group, featuring the highest mean EPI and the highest growth rate. Petroleum production and air transport sectors are those featuring the lowest environmental performance. Therefore, the latter sectors should be given an especial importance when developing strategies for increase in sustainability. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Data envelopment analysis; Economic sectors; Environmental performance index; Lithuania","Carbon; Climate change; Data envelopment analysis; Economic analysis; Economics; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Petroleum transportation; Climate change mitigation; Economic sectors; Environmental performance; Environmental performance indices; Environmental pressures; Lithuania; Nitrous oxide emissions; Production economics; Sustainable development","Baležentis, T.; Lithuanian Institute of Agrarian Economics, V.

Going beyond a focus on general limits and barriers, this comment suggests that one important issue is that climate change has not yet been sufficiently integrated into the state regulative structure of legislation and policy-making. A comparison between three cases suggests that local developments that are not supported in particular by binding regulation are unlikely to achieve the same general level of implementation as issues for which such regulative demands (and thereby also requirements for prioritization) exist.

Data collected from 250 households were used for OC estimation. REDD+ payment was estimated as the net present value (NPV) of agricultural rent and forest rent during land clearing, minus net returns from sustainable wood harvest, divided by the corresponding reduction in carbon stock. The median compensation required to protect the current carbon stock in the two vegetation types ranged from USD 1 tCO2e−1 for the montane forest to USD 39 tCO2e−1 for the degraded miombo woodlands, of which up to 70 % and 16 %, respectively, were for compensating OCs from forest rent during land clearing. The figures were significantly higher when the cost of farmers’ own labor was not taken into account in NPV calculations. The results also highlighted that incentives in the form of sustainable harvests could offset up to 55 % of the total median OC to protect the montane forest and up to 45 % to protect the miombo woodlands, depending on the wage rates. The findings suggest that given the possible factors that can potentially affect estimates of REDD+ payments, avoiding deforestation of the montane forest would be feasible under the REDD+ scheme. However, implementation of the policy in villages around the miombo area would require very high compensation levels. © 2014, The Author(s).","Agricultural rent; Forest rent; Miombo woodland; Montane forest; Opportunity cost; REDD+; Sustainable harvest","agroecology; carbon sequestration; climate change; compensation system; cost analysis; deforestation; degradation; emission control; environmental economics; incentive; montane forest; policy implementation; sustainable forestry; vegetation type; village; wage; woodland; Morogoro [Tanzania]; Tanzania; Nucleopolyhedrovirus","Araya, M.M.; Department of Ecology and Natural Resource Management, P.O.

It is believed that water resources will play a growing important role in Europe and in particular in the countries south of the Alps, where climate change could hit harder (EEA, 2014). Without appropriate interventions, water will turn from a good hearty undervalued to a scarce and precious resource, whose distribution will be less and less equitable, resulting in growing conflicts for its use. As already recognized by the European directives (2000/60/EC and 2006/118/EC), the theme of quantitative management of water resources is therefore a strategic issue that can allow the reduction of the risks and costs associated with climate change. Integrated management of both surface and groundwater for sustainable use nowadays represents more and more a key concern in environmental policies and water management. The goal of this work is to assess the effects on groundwater storage of a new management of irrigation waters. The highly variable availability of water resources during the hydrological season could be particularly troublesome in the management of irrigation systems, since they need water in seasons (spring-summer) when usually its availability has a depletion. Storage of groundwater in aquifers in colder seasons could be used to soften irrigation systems water deficit in drier ones. Specifically, the practice of ""winter irrigation"", i.e. the use of the main irrigation channels to recharge aquifers during the colder seasons, could increase water resource availability for irrigation during the drier growing seasons. A pilot groundwater flow transient model (MODFLOW2000, Harbaugh et al., 2000) with a domain of about 255 km2 was implemented in the north zone of Lodi Province, including a large part of the Consorzio Muzza irrigation district. The model was then run to estimate change in groundwater resource availability in two main scenarios: in the first scenario the storage in the shallow aquifer was computed in the colder period (October-March), when irrigation is not occurring; for this case, it was used measured monthly rainfall, average temperature for the period 2004-2013 (representing actual climate conditions) and an estimations of water volume used for irrigation. In the second scenario, an integrated management approach of irrigation and groundwater was tested, adopting ""winter irrigation"". Both scenarios want to assess if water storage in aquifers in colder periods could represent an additional water volume useful to mitigate possible climate changes effects on crops. © Società Geologica Italiana, Roma 2016.","Climate change mitigations; MODFLOW; Transient model; Winter irrigation",,,,"Societa Geologica Italiana",20358008,,,,"English","Rend.

The Government's decision to phase-out nuclear energy exacerbates Switzerland's climate change mitigation goals. Response to this challenge requires systemic changes to the energy system, which is generally a long-term, uncertain and systemic process, affected by technology choices across the entire energy system. A comprehensive Swiss TIMES Energy system Model (STEM) with high temporal detail has been developed for the analysis of plausible low-carbon energy pathways focusing on uncertainties related to policy (climate change mitigation and acceptability of new centralised electricity generation) and international fuel prices. Increasing electrification of end-uses is seen across the scenarios, resulting in continuous growth in electricity demands. The electrification of heating and e-mobility substitute direct use of fossil fuels in end-use sectors and contribute to a significant carbon dioxide emission (CO2) reduction. Centralised gas power plants and renewables become key source of electricity supply. Given the phaseout of nuclear generation, clear policy signals are required to ensure capacity is built to achieve a low-carbon energy system. At the same time, it is also essential to ensure consistency between the electricity sector and end-use energy policies. For the long-term carbon reduction target, some non-cost-effective conservation measures are important early in the period because they are available only at the time of building renovation. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Energy system analysis; Energy systems model; Low carbon scenarios; Nuclear phaseout","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Electric utilities; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Global warming; Historic preservation; Uncertainty analysis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation; Electricity generation; Energy system analysis; Energy systems modeling; Low carbon; Low-carbon energy systems; Nuclear phaseout; Climate change; alternative energy; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon emission; climate change; climate change; electrification; electrification; energy policy; mitigation; mitigation; nuclear power plant; nuclear power plant; renewable resource; renewable resource; Switzerland","Kannan, R.; Energy Economics Group, Switzerland; email: kannan.ramachandran@psi.ch",,"Elsevier B.V.",01409883,,EECOD,,"English","Energy Econ.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84960343291

The words ‘apiculture’ and ‘beekeeping’ tend to be applied loosely and used synonymously. The product that most people first associate with bees is honey, although beekeeping generates much more than just honey. Honey is one of several different products that can be harvested: others are beeswax, pollen, propolis, royal jelly and bee venom, and the use of bees in apitherapy, which are “medicine” using the bee and its products. In many ecosystems, bees are important pollinators ensuring the maintenance of those ecosystems and for the production of good quality and quantity of different crops. Beekeeping can be an important sustainable and alternative source of income in rural areas, benefiting communities living in and around forests. Most importantly beekeeping can also be a practical tool for raising the awareness of these communities on the importance of forests management and for stimulating their conservation by improving their biodiversity. Through promotion of these production functions, it would trigger the global effort to mitigate climate change. © 2016, Fundacion CIPAV.

Despite this, little work has considered how intention to adopt differs from actual adoption of climate change practices in agriculture. Applying the Theory of Planned Behavior we aim to assess whether different factors affect intended versus actual adoption of climate behaviors among farmers in New Zealand. Data were collected through mixed methods (37 interviews and a telephone survey of 490 farmers) in two regions of New Zealand 2010–2012. Through multiple regression models we test hypotheses related to the Theory of Planned Behavior around the role of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived capacity in affecting intended and actual adoption. Results suggest that there are different drivers of intended and actual adoption of climate change practices. Climate change attitudes and belief is only associated with intended not actual adoption. We find no evidence that subjective norms (climate change policy support) significantly influence either intention or actual adoption. Only perceived capacity and self-efficacy were important predictors of both intended and actual adoption. These results suggest a disconnect between intended and actual behavior change and that using data about intention as a guiding factor for program and policy design may not be prudent. Furthermore, fostering perceived capacity and self-efficacy for individuals may be crucial for encouraging both intended and actual adoption of climate adapting and mitigating behaviors. © 2015, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Regression analysis; Adaptation strategies; Behavior change; Climate change mitigation; Climate change policies; Multiple regression model; Subjective norm; Telephone survey; Theory of Planned Behavior; Climate change; adoption behavior; climate change; data acquisition; farmers attitude; multiple regression; policy development; strategic approach; survey method; New Zealand","Niles, M.T.; Department of Nutrition and Food Sciences and Food Systems Initiative, 109 Carrigan Drive, 350 Marsh Life Sciences Building, United States; email: mtniles@uvm.edu",,"Springer Netherlands",01650009,,CLCHD,,"English","Clim.

This can shift the economically optimal rotation age, and incorporate rents for a wider range of ecosystem service offerings. A mixed stand economic optimization model was used to determine the optimal stand mixture and inter-species climate regulation trade-offs. Mixed forest dynamics between deciduous silver birch (Betula pendula Roth.) and coniferous Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.) were evaluated. The sensitivity of our results to the absolute species-specific differences in albedo parameter values was also conducted. Results indicated that a synergistic climate regulation trade-off between the two species exists. The optimal rotation for the combined carbon storage and albedo effect was equivalent to that of the carbon storage only case. Differences in absolute albedo impacts were most sensitive at high discount rates, for 'climate only' management, and over increasing offset prices. These results demonstrate the importance of parameter certainty in the promotion of PES in forestry. They also show that mixed stands can promote more efficient trade-offs between forest ecosystem service offerings and provide a basis for diversifying between ecosystem functions. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Albedo; Carbon storage; Climate change; Economic optimization; Mixed forest; Optimum rotation and thinning","albedo; carbon sequestration; climate change; coniferous forest; deciduous forest; ecological economics; economic analysis; ecosystem function; ecosystem service; forest dynamics; forest management; mixed forest; optimization; sensitivity analysis; thinning; trade-off; willingness to pay; Betula pendula; Picea abies","Matthies, B.D.; University of Helsinki, P.O.

In this context, sociotechnical (ST) transitions and social-ecological (SE) resilience are two prominent normative agendas. Reviewing these literatures reveals how both share a complex-systems epistemology with inherent limitations, often producing managerial governance recommendations and foregrounding material over social drivers of change. Further interdisciplinary dialogue with social theory is essential if these frameworks are to become more theoretically robust and capable of informing effective, let alone transformational, climate change governance. To illustrate this potential, ideas from Deleuze and Guattari's political writing as well as other approaches that utilize the notion social fields (as opposed to sociosystems) are combined to more fully theorize the origins and enactment of social change. First, the logic of systems is replaced with the contingency of assemblages to reveal how pluralism, not elitism, can produce more ambitious and politicized visions of the future. In particular, this view encourages us to see social and ecological tensions as opportunities for thinking and acting differently rather than as mere technical problems to be solved. Secondly, the setting of social fields is introduced to situate and explain the power of ideas and the role of agency in times of uncertainty. The potential of such insights is already visible in some strands of climate change mitigation and adaptation research, but more needs to be done to advance this field and to bring it into dialogue with the mainstream systems based literature. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"Ecology; Climate change mitigation; Inherent limitations; Social changes; Social theory; Sociotechnical; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; governance approach; interdisciplinary approach; social change; social theory","Gillard, R.; School of Earth and Environment, United Kingdom; email: r.o.gillard@leeds.ac.uk",,"Wiley-Blackwell",17577780,,,,"English","Wiley Interdiscip Rev.

This approach is not always coherent, especially in the context of other serious issues South Africa is facing, such as poverty alleviation. Policies implemented to mitigate climate change might increase negative health affects due to unanticipated outcomes (e.g. increased local air pollution), and these indirect consequences must therefore be taken into account when devising mitigation strategies. However, greenhouse gas mitigation policies can also have co-benefits and positive impacts on local air pollution. An evidence-based approach that takes into account greenhouse gas emissions, ambient air pollutants, economic factors (affordability, cost optimisation), social factors (poverty alleviations, public health benefits), and political acceptability is needed tackle these challenges. A proposal is made that use of an integrated climate/air pollution techno-economic optimising model, such as the Greenhouse Gas and Air Pollution Synergies (GAINS) model, may provide a rational decision support tool to guide policy makers into effective strategies for combined Climate Change and Air Quality mitigation measures. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Climate change; Co-benefits; Contradicting policies; GAINS; South Africa","air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; carbon footprint; climate change; economic aspect; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; human; priority journal; public health; Review; social aspect; South Africa","Klausbruckner, C.; Johannes Kepler UniversityAustria; email: c.klausbruckner@gmx.at",,"Elsevier Ltd",14629011,,ESCPF,,"English","Environ.

Focusing on the mitigation of global warming, we developed an uncertainty model for the optimal use of straw in China based on available studies of life-cycle assessment that have determined the advantages of energy savings and reductions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) of 14 conversion technologies. The current pattern of straw use has saved China 0.75 EJ of energy and has reduced GHGs by 270.76 Mt CO2e on average annually. Among all competitive uses, the use of straw as forage was most environmental friendly, followed by the uses of straw as alternative sources of nutrients and energy.

This synthesis article describes possible positive reaction mechanisms from different fields of economics, some of which have scarcely been linked to climate economics previously. One effect may be behavioural, a reaction motivated by fairness, reciprocity, or norms. Second, other nations may interpret the leader's action as a signal on his preference or the value of the objective and adjust their own policy based on the new information. Third, the leader may provide a service to other nations, which decreases their costs and risks. The followers could benefit by learning successful policies, adopting technologies, and obtaining information on the cost of environmental policy. All of these mechanisms have in common that the leader sets an example with the intention of motivating others to contribute to the public good. Policy relevance A large body of both theoretical and empirical evidence shows that leading by example in climate change mitigation by a small group of nations has important potential for motivating other nations to follow. Modern economics has identified a range of mechanisms to explain why simple free-riding is unlikely to dominate the reaction to leadership. One such mechanism is described by behavioural economics. Humans often behave as conditional cooperators, meaning that they are willing to do their bit once a leader has done his. A second mechanism is the transmission of a credible signal that the leader considers climate change mitigation to be important. Finally, the leader gains knowledge, which spills over to other countries and thus moves their cost–benefit ratio in favour of mitigation. This evidence implies that leadership provides a promising alternative to stimulate the global cooperation that will eventually be needed to stabilize the climate. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.","climate change; economic leadership; public good provision","climate change; cost-benefit analysis; economic impact; environmental economics; environmental policy; globalization; mitigation; public goods","Schwerhoff, G.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, PO Box 601203, Germany; email: schwerhoff@pik-potsdam.de",,"Taylor and Francis Ltd.",14693062,,,,"English","Clim.

Among the many economic areas in China, Yangtze River Delta (YRD) takes the lead. The macro economy development and energy use status quo of both China and YRD are depicted, the past and current situation of air pollution and GHGs emissions is presented, and detailed national and local policies are reviewed. GAINS-China model is deployed in this study to evaluate the air pollution reduction and climate change mitigation achievements in the industry sector under the current policy of the three areas (i.e. Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai) in YRD from 2005 to 2030. According to the simulation results, the total population would grow marginally while the economy of YRD will keep booming in the next two decades. The total energy consumption of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai in 2030 would be 2.36, 2.61 and 1.81 times that of 2005, with the industry sector still playing the biggest part. SO2 emissions would be well under-control by 2030. The NOX emissions all show steady growing trends, while the PM2.5 emissions show different trends for three areas. The ensemble average years of life lost has a complex correlation with the total population and the PM2.5 concentration. CO2 emissions are still in predominant position among all the GHGs emissions, showing a steady growing trend towards 2030. All GHGs emissions amount in YRD would be 1.76 times that of 2005. The differences among the emissions in the three areas may due to reasons like economy scale, industrial composition, energy structure, and enforcement rate of policy. The uncertainties of this study may come from inaccurate prediction of scenario parameters and the expected policy changes in the future, and the emissions from the restructure of industry should be considered as well. In terms of achieving sustainable industrial development, YRD's governments should restrict the scale of energy-intensive industries, improve the primary energy structure, and take co-benefits concepts and methods more into policy-making processes. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Air pollution; Co-benefits; GAINS-model; GHGs; Industry sector; Yangtze River Delta","Air pollution; Climate change; Climate models; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Pollution; River pollution; Rivers; Climate change mitigation; Co benefits; Energy intensive industries; GHGs; Industrial development; Industry sectors; Total energy consumption; Yangtze river delta; Industrial economics","Jiang, P.; Department of Environmental Science and Engineering, China; email: jp338@163.com",,"Elsevier Ltd",09596526,,JCROE,,"English","J.

However, they tend to be considered separately in projects and policies because of their different objectives and scales. Agriculture and forestry are related to both adaptation and mitigation: they contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and removals, are vulnerable to climate variations, and form part of adaptive strategies for rural livelihoods. We assessed how climate change project design documents (PDDs) considered a joint contribution to adaptation and mitigation in forestry and agriculture in the tropics, by analyzing 201 PDDs from adaptation funds, mitigation instruments, and project standards [e.g., climate community and biodiversity (CCB)]. We analyzed whether PDDs established for one goal reported an explicit contribution to the other (i.e., whether mitigation PDDs contributed to adaptation and vice versa). We also examined whether the proposed activities or expected outcomes allowed for potential contributions to the two goals. Despite the separation between the two goals in international and national institutions, 37 % of the PDDs explicitly mentioned a contribution to the other objective, although only half of those substantiated it. In addition, most adaptation (90 %) and all mitigation PDDs could potentially report a contribution to at least partially to the other goal. Some adaptation project developers were interested in mitigation for the prospect of carbon funding, whereas mitigation project developers integrated adaptation to achieve greater long-term sustainability or to attain CCB certification. International and national institutions can provide incentives for projects to harness synergies and avoid trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation. © 2015, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Ecosystem services; Emissions; Landscape; Livelihoods; REDD+; Vulnerability","Agriculture; Biodiversity; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Particulate emissions; Timber; Ecosystem services; Landscape; Livelihoods; REDD; Vulnerability; Climate change; carbon; adaptive management; agricultural practice; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem service; emission control; forestry practice; project assessment; vulnerability; agriculture; air pollution control; Article; biodiversity; certification; climate change; deforestation; ecosystem restoration; environmental protection; forestry; funding; tropics; agriculture; climate; forestry; procedures; Agriculture; Climate; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Forestry","Kongsager, R.; UNEP DTU Partnership on Energy, Marmorvej 51, Denmark; email: ricokongsager@gmail.com",,"Springer New York LLC",0364152X,,EMNGD,"26306792","English","Environ.

Applying a quantitative content analysis approach, all Danish LG action plans within the climate and energy field has been collected and coded, giving insight into the extent of LG CAPs. We assess the extent, targets and scope of LG CAPs and find that Danish LGs are highly involved in mitigation activities with a widespread CAP adoption and an overall high degree of sectoral coverage on base year accounts and action plans, albeit with some significant shortcomings. If current LG CAPs were to form the basis of a decentralised climate governance system, some improvements in target level and sectoral coverage should be implemented. The utilization of regional supporting structures facilitating a gradual improvement seems especially promising. In addition the research points to the significant mitigation potential of considering the full spectrum of local government actors, not simply the pioneers and how local CAPs outside urban pioneers require additional local policy framing to succeed.

These changes are motivated by the need to adapt to the uncertainties and risks of climate change, and by the need to enlist their carbon storage and sequestration capacity as part of global mitigation efforts. These changes do however raise concerns regarding the potential implications for forest biodiversity. Here we evaluate these concerns by assessing the biodiversity implications of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies (CCAMS) being implemented in the production forests of Sweden. We do so by identifying biodiversity goals aimed specifically at closing the existing gap between the habitat requirements of forest-dependent species, and the conditions provided by production forests, in terms of tree species composition, forest structures, and spatio-temporal forest patterns. We then use the existing literature to determinewhether and bywhich pathway each CCAMS is likely to bridge or extend this gap. Our results indicate that CCAMS will often come into direct or partial conflict with Swedish biodiversity goals in production forests. Furthermore, some CCAMS which are inconsistent with biodiversity goals, such as logging residue removal, are being implemented more extensively than those which were most consistent with biodiversity goals. We nevertheless challenge the necessity of setting the preservation of forest biodiversity against climate change mitigation and adaptation. Weclarify howCCAMS with negative biodiversity implications may still be implemented without adverse outcomes, if coupled with conservation interventions, or combined with other CCAMS deemed complementary in habitat provision. © 2015.",,,"Felton, A.; Southern Swedish Forest Research Centre, Box 49, Sweden; email: adam.felton@slu.se",,"Elsevier Ltd",00063207,,BICOB,,"English","Biol.

The aim of the present study is to evaluate the performance of a single-effect distillation unit and the potential of its integration with a concentrated solar power system as a mitigation technique to the water scarcity. Specifically, a single-effect distillation unit for seawater desalination was developed and its performance in terms of performance ratio (PR) (ratio of distillate product and steam fed to the unit) was experimentally investigated. The main parameters examined were the thermal input power, and the temperature and flow rate of the inlet seawater. For several seawater flow rates, three different initial heat loads were used (Tst,1, Tst,2, Tst,3). Experiments were repeated for two seawater inlet temperatures, Tsw1, Tsw2. A one-dimensional model based on conservation of mass and energy was developed to predict the performance of the device. The results showed that lower heat input load results to a higher value of the PR of the unit and also under constant heat load, a higher temperature of the seawater lead to higher distillate product. The developed model adequately captured the behavior of the device. Thus, it is concluded that such a unit should be expanded into a multiple-effect unit and also implemented with a concentrated solar power system as a mitigation technique to the water scarcity of the island. © 2014 Balaban Desalination Publications.

Firm-level activities conducted to mitigate climate change are increasingly becoming a strategic issue for all corporations worldwide. Design/methodology/approach – By using a systematic review, and a vote-counting approach, the vastly dispersed collection of qualitative and quantitative data available in the literature is integrated, to explore how 3CM is conceptualised and measured in empirical research. In particular, common trends and contradictory findings are illustrated. Findings – The present review demonstrates that no researchers have yet analysed the role of 3CM in corporate management control systems. Furthermore, three shortcomings of existing empirical research were identified and some directions for future research were outlined. These regard analysing the positioning of 3CM in corporate management control systems, the further development of measurements of 3CM performance and a consideration of the evolution of 3CM over time. Originality/value – Firm-level activities carried out to mitigate climate change are increasingly becoming a strategic issue for all corporations worldwide. However, the growing stream of management literature on climate change has not yet diffused across disciplinary boundaries, as it suffers from a remarkably diverse terminology and differing conceptualisations and measurements of its research objectives. The present review elaborates on the existing empirical evidence and suggests recommendations for future research. © 2016, Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Corporate strategy; Systematic literature review",,"Guenther, E.; Technische Universitaet DresdenGermany; email: edeltraud.guenther@mailbox.tu-dresden.de",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",20408269,,,,"English","Manage.

Community forests (CFs) have capacity to contribute in both roles as local communities are collectively working to improve forests and to fulfil their own basic forest product needs. Nowadays, an incentive mechanism for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation, conservation of forests, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of carbon stocks in forests (REDD+) is emerging and already has received considerable attention in achieving climate change mitigation whereas there has been little analysis of its potential contribution to adaptation objectives, particularly at the community level. Therefore the overarching goal of this study was to analyse CFs from a mitigation and adaptation perspective. This study assesses 105 CFs covering a range of forest types managed by socially diverse communities of Nepal. Two point carbon data (2010 and 2013) was analysed to investigate differences in carbon stocks in these forests following the introduction of a REDD+ pilot program in Nepal. Similarly, a document review and focused group discussions were organised to evaluate the livelihood support and adaptation potential of pilot REDD+ CFs. This study found that community forest user groups (CFUGs) have increased forest carbon stocks and that the pilot REDD+ projects are also delivering livelihood benefits which ultimately will help adaptation to adverse climatic conditions. However, the motivation for communities to realise REDD+ carbon incentives may reduce the food supplement capacity of forests by limiting vegetation diversity. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon stock; Climate change; Community forests; Livelihoods; REDD+","Deforestation; Forestry; Carbon stocks; Climate change mitigation; Community forest; Community forest user groups; Livelihoods; REDD; Sustainable management; Vegetation diversities; Climate change","Pandey, S.S.; Institute for Agriculture and Environment, Australia; email: shiva.pandey@usq.edu.au",,"Elsevier",03781127,,FECMD,,"English","For.

In the Municipality of Solrød in Denmark, a novel bioenergy concept for anaerobic co-digestion of food industry residues, manure and beach-cast seaweed has been developed and tested in order to quantify the potential for synergies between climate change mitigation and coastal eutrophication management in the Køge Bay catchment. The biogas plant, currently under construction, was designed to handle an annual input of up to 200,000t of biomass based on four main fractions: pectin wastes, carrageenan wastes, manure and beach-cast seaweed. This paper describes how this bioenergy concept can contribute to strengthening the linkages between climate change mitigation strategies and Water Framework Directive (WFD) action planning. Our assessments of the projected biogas plant indicate an annual reduction of GHG emissions of approx. 40,000t CO2 equivalents, corresponding to approx. 1/3 of current total GHG emissions in the Municipality of Solrød. In addition, nitrogen and phosphorous loads to Køge Bay are estimated to be reduced by approx. 63tyr.-1 and 9tyr.-1, respectively, contributing to the achievement of more than 70% of the nutrient reduction target set for Køge Bay in the first WFD river basin management plan. This study shows that anaerobic co-digestion of the specific food industry residues, pig manure and beach-cast seaweed is feasible and that there is a very significant, cost-effective GHG and nutrient loading mitigation potential for this bioenergy concept. Our research demonstrates how an integrated planning process where considerations about the total environment are integrated into the design and decision processes can support the development of this kind of holistic bioenergy solutions. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Climate change mitigation; Eutrophication; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Nutrients; Water framework directive","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Beaches; Biogas; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Catchments; Cost effectiveness; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Eutrophication; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Manures; Nutrients; River pollution; Seaweed; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Anaerobic co-digestion; Climate change mitigation; Coastal eutrophication; Environmental policy; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Protection of groundwater; River basin management plans; Water Framework Directives; Climate change; agriculture; bioenergy; biogas; carbon emission; climate change; coastal zone; environmental policy; eutrophication; greenhouse gas; nutrient cycling; Denmark; Koge Bay; Suidae","Kaspersen, B.S.; Roskilde University, Department of Environmental, Social and Spatial Change, Universitetsvej 1, P.O.

Given that mitigation activities can benefit or hinder adaptation, and vice versa, promoting activities that contribute to both objectives can increase the efficiency of fund allocation and minimize trade-offs, particularly in land-related activities such as agriculture and forestry. The purpose of this study is to analyze how climate funding organizations consider the integration of adaptation and mitigation. Design/methodology/approach – The authors interviewed representatives of climate funds directed toward forestry and agriculture to gain a better understanding of how they perceive the benefits, risks and barriers of an integrated approach; whether they have concrete activities for promoting this approach; and how they foresee the future of adaptation–mitigation integration. Findings – Interviews revealed a diverse range of perceived benefits, risks and barriers at local, national and global scales. Most interviewees focused on the local benefits of this integration (e.g. increasing the resilience of forest carbon projects), whereas others emphasized global risks (e.g. decreasing global funding efficiency because of project complexity). Despite the general interest in projects and policies integrating adaptation and mitigation, few relevant actions have been implemented by organizations engaged in climate change finance. Originality/value – This paper provides new insight into how the representatives of climate funds perceive and act on the integration of adaptation and mitigation in forestry and agriculture. The findings by the authors can inform the development of procedures for climate change finance, such as the Green Climate Fund. While managers of climate funds face barriers in promoting an integrated approach to adaptation and mitigation, they also have the capacity and the ambition to overcome them. © 2016, Bruno Locatelli, Giacomo Fedele, Virginie Fayolle and Alastair Baglee.

Many decisions regarding energy and transportation infrastructures, buildings, sanitary and storm-water management, flood risk assessment and also biodiversity protection take place at the city level. In this context, climate change issues have been recognized as fundamental for urban planning, requiring an integrated response with combined mitigation and adaptation strategies. This paper develops an approach to assess some of the trade-offs between climate change vulnerability and mitigation options for the residential building stock of 29 Portuguese Municipalities, within the context of a comprehensive Municipal Adaptation Strategies Project, ClimAdaPT.Local. The paper presents a methodology to evaluate climate change vulnerability of the residential building stock regarding thermal comfort of the occupants, based on expected impacts from climate change measures and adaptive capacity. Moreover, the impact on climate change vulnerability is assessed as a function of a set of mitigation options taken at the building level aiming to explore whether it would be cost-effective to invest on mitigation or adaptation measures or both. Results are presented for the municipality of Cascais and major findings show the interplay between mitigation and adaptation measures which can be synergetic or antagonistic. The approach and methodology are being validated with the 29 municipalities covering varied climatic zones, construction materials and socio-economic contexts, which will result in a comprehensive range of trade-offs between mitigation options and adaptation needs at the city level.

This chapter addresses the complex relationship between these two policy domains, their scientific background and the related acceptability issue, which varies substantially among countries and social groups and is influenced by social and cultural factors. The first section of this chapter describes the relationship between air quality and climate change policies. Indeed, global CO2 reduction objectives require complex adaptations of socio-economic behaviours that might not directly appear to be related to pollution reduction or to improvement the exposure of citizens to harmful pollutants. Recent studies, however, have confirmed that air pollution and its impacts are one of the main environmental concerns for citizens, even if relevant differences in public perception between countries still remain. This section also addresses the ambiguities and conflicts that characterise communication between experts and citizens. The second section briefly describes recent scientific evidence that shows the possibility of coupling air quality and climate change mitigation benefits with policies targeted at specific pollutants called short lived climate forcers (SLCF). The third section spells out some preliminary research questions on the acceptability of these policies and their complex relationship with individual interests and cultural contexts. Linking air quality to climate change could be a win-win strategy to increase the social acceptability of specific policies and their implementation if knowledge and communication gaps between citizens and policy makers will be reduced. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Air quality; Climate change; Eurobarometer; Policy acceptability; Social perception",,"Sergi, V.; University of UrbinoItaly; email: vittorio.sergi@uniurb.it",,"Springer",16102002,,,,"English","Climate Change Manag.",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071391799

Data collected were analysed using Atlas.ti and SPSS. Most of the women in the rural areas are aware of the impacts of climate change in their environment, especially, on their livelihoods. However, the awareness level has not impacted on them positively to adopt any mitigation and adaptation strategies.

First, the national commitments of reduction or limitation of the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) will be described. These commitments result from the Kyoto Protocol (KP), the Doha amendment of the KP, and the European legislation related to the Europe 2020 targets on energy and climate change. Then, the time-series of the GHG emissions of the country will be presented, both aggregated at the country level and at the level of the main source sectors. The trends of the emission time-series will be assessed using specific indices. Moreover, based on the latest official GHG inventory of Greece, the level of achievement of the national commitment under the KP and the expected surplus of GHG emission allowances is estimated. By the consideration of the official GHG emission projection scenarios, the progress of the country in achieving the emission reduction targets for the period 2013–2020 will be assessed, especially for the sectors that are not included under the Emission Trading System of the European Union. The effect of the implemented, adopted and planned mitigation policies will be also presented. Although an over-arching adaptation strategy is not yet available in Greece, adaptation measures are currently under implementation as part of a broader network of measures that apply to the specific areas of identified vulnerabilities. A summary of these measures will be presented in this work. The main sector specific strategies and action plans on climate change adaptation issues will be also presented. These are mainly incorporated in the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 ‘Aleksandros Mpaltatzis’, the National Strategy for the Management of Water Resources, the General and the Specific National Frameworks for Spatial Planning and Sustainable Development, the National Biodiversity Strategy, and the National Action Plan for Combating Desertification. © 2016, Springer International Publishing Switzerland.","Adaptation; Climate change; Mitigation","Biodiversity; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; International law; Planning; Regional planning; Time series; Water management; Adaptation; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Combating desertification; Emission reduction targets; Emission trading systems; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Mitigation; Climate change","Sebos, I.; Department of Chemical Engineering, Zografou Campus, 9 Heroon Polytechniou Street, Greece; email: isebos@mail.ntua.gr",,"Springer Verlag",18653529,,,,"English","Green Energy and Technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044478124

Approximately 92 % of organic chemical products are derived from oil and gas. In addition, these same resources are generally used to provide the large quantities of process heat and power needed by the industry. In the modern petrochemical industry, oil and gas inputs for both raw material and process energy compose around 50 % of the operating costs. Not only is the chemical industry (including petrochemicals) the industrial sector with the highest emissions worldwide, it is also very vulnerable to variations in fossil fuel prices and, potentially, climate policies. Efficiency has long been a major factor in determining competitiveness in petrochemicals, and the sector has a high success rate in reducing its energy intensity. Yet, while global use of oil for energy grew globally by 12 % between 2002 and 2012, the use of oil for chemical feedstocks grew 21 %. It now represents 9 % of total global oil use and 6 % of total global gas use. Reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in an industry that is so dependent on fossil fuels presents a significant challenge. This chapter introduces the history of the modern chemical industry and the establishment of its close relationship with the oil industry. This relationship has recently come under strain as new sources of oil and gas are increasingly exploited, and growth in hydrocarbon demand for chemical products outpaces that for energy from these sources. It goes on to describe some of the major chemical processes, their GHG emissions, and their geographical variations. The benefits and challenges of several technological mitigation options are discussed. These are recycling, efficiency gains through cogeneration, CO2 capture and storage (CCS), and feedstock switching via biorefining. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Agrol; Benzene; Biodegradable plastics; Biomass; Bioplastics; Biopol; Biorefinery; BP; C1 chemistry; Carbon; CCS (carbon dioxide capture and storage); Chemical feedstocks; Chemical industry; CHP; Coal; Coal-to-liquids; Dematerialization; DuPont; Energy; Energy policy; Ethanol; Ethylene; Fossil fuels; Fuel; Gas; Green chemistry; History of energy; ICI; Industrial ecology; Innovation studies; Lifecycle assessment; Long-run energy use; Methanol; Oil; Olefins; Peak oil; Petrochemicals; Petroleum; PLA; Plastics; Platform chemicals; Recycling; Refining; Renewable energy; Renewable raw materials; Resource hierarchy; Resource sustainability; Shell; Socio-technical dynamics; Solvents; Standard oil; Sustainable energy; Syngas; Synthesis gas; Synthetic fibers; Wartime (stimulus to innovation)","Benzene; Benzene refining; Biodegradable polymers; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Climate change; Coal; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal storage; Crude oil; Efficiency; Elastomers; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Ethylene; Feedstocks; Fossil fuels; Fueling; Gallium; Gas emissions; Gas fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Oils and fats; Olefins; Operating costs; Organic chemicals; Organic solvents; Petrochemicals; Petroleum industry; Plastic recycling; Plastics; Plastics industry; Recycling; Refining; Solvents; Synthesis gas; Synthetic fibers; Agrol; Bio-plastics; Biodegradable plastics; Biopol; Biorefineries; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Chemical feedstocks; Coal To Liquid; Dematerialization; DuPont; Energy; Energy use; Green chemistry; Industrial ecology; Innovation studies; Life-cycle assessments; Peak Oil; Platform chemicals; Renewable energies; Renewable raw materials; Resource hierarchies; Resource sustainability; Shell; Sociotechnical; Sustainable energy; Syn-gas; Wartime (stimulus to innovation); Petroleum refining","Bennett, S.J.; Imperial Centre for Energy Policy and Technology, United Kingdom; email: simon.bennett04@imperial.ac.uk",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319144092; 9783319144085,,,"English","Handb. of Climate Change Mitig. and Adaptation, Second Edition",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024899075

Climate change impacts were assessed through past, current, and future conditions. Past information showed damages due to extreme weather events. Current production and climate conditions showed potential vulnerability. Future climate change scenarios and crop growth modeling predicted long-term impacts on crop production. The impacts of many adaptation measures and mitigation options were evaluated to reduce risks and losses from climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Results showed that climate change has caused strong impacts on agriculture in Vietnam. It has caused severe damages in the past, and it is likely to cause high vulnerability and heavy crop production losses in the future. Flat lands experience stronger impacts than highlands, with the Mekong River Delta suffering the strongest impacts, followed by the Coastal Central area and Red River Delta. As a country strongly impacted by climate change, it has suffered many extreme events and disasters. The agricultural sector has developed suitable adaptation measures to cope with the extreme events. Vietnam maintains a high agricultural productivity not only to feed more than 70 million people but also to export a high amount of food and foodstuffs. Vietnam is the leading cashew nut exporter, second highest rice exporter, and third highest coffee exporter in the world. However, with extensive areas of rice paddy production and high animal populations, Vietnam’s agriculture contributes substantial greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. As a result, the Vietnamese agricultural sector is developing and implementing many mitigation options, such as alternative wetting and drying irrigation, biogas digestion, composting, and converting rice land to non-rice land. These policies target a 20 % GHG emission reduction by 2020 in comparison to the “business-as-usual” scenario. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Climate change scenario; Crop production; Disaster; Vulnerability","Crops; Cultivation; Disasters; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Productivity; Risk assessment; Agricultural environments; Agricultural productivity; Climate change adaptation; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Crop production; Extreme weather events; Vulnerability; Climate change","Van Mai, T.; Institute for Agricultural Environment, Phudo, South Tu Liem, Viet Nam; email: maivantrinh@gmail.com",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319144092; 9783319144085,,,"English","Handb. of Climate Change Mitig. and Adaptation, Second Edition",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024887091

First we trace the policy process surrounding UNFCCC, Kyoto Protocol, and Post-Kyoto Protocol negotiations, mostly focusing on the activities in the ICAO. Key factors in the policy process are (1) the disparities in the field of international aviation among the nations, such as income level and preferences between environment and growth. Such disparities could be interpreted as the notion of “common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities (CBDR)"" in the Kyoto Protocol. The second key factor is (2) uncertainties surrounding the impact of GHG emission on utilities of nations. Then we look into the theoretical developments in the field of international aviation from the economics viewpoint. Main objectives are to illustrate the impact of market-based mechanism (MBM), such as the emission allowance trading, and the inherent difficulties to reach social optimal allocations through the bargaining among nations in the presence of nations’ disparities and uncertainties of GHG emission’s impact on nations’ utilities. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Aviation; Carbon-neutral growth CO2 emission allowance; CBDR; Climate change; CO2 emission allowance; EU-ETS; ICAO; International air cargo/passenger transport; Kyoto protocol; Lindahl-Bowen-Samuelson condition; Market-based mechanism; Social optimality; Uncertainty; Uncertainty","Air navigation; Aviation; Carbon dioxide; Civil aviation; Commerce; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Air cargo; CBDR; CO2 emissions; ICAO; KYOTO protocol; Lindahl-Bowen-Samuelson condition; Market-based mechanisms; Optimality; Uncertainty; Climate change","Hihara, K.; Graduate School of Public Policy, Hongo Bunkyo-ku, Japan; email: hihara@pp.u-tokyo.ac.jp",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319144092; 9783319144085,,,"English","Handb. of Climate Change Mitig. and Adaptation, Second Edition",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024877371

In addition, a novel advantage will be investigated in this work: the possibility of a synergetic use for carbon-free energy production and coastal protection. All in all, these advantages make wave energy a promising alternative to conventional energy sources. In this chapter the fundamentals of the wave resource and its characterization are outlined. The technologies for wave energy conversion are classified according to three criteria, the most representative WECs are presented, and the technological challenges discussed. Next, the environmental impacts of wave energy extraction are analyzed, with a focus on the reduction of coastal erosion. If there are two main strategies to cope with climate change, mitigation and adaptation, wave farms participate on both. Indeed, wave energy contributes to mitigating climate change by two means, one acting on the cause, the other on the effect: (i) by bringing down carbon emissions (cause) through its production of renewable energy and (ii) by reducing coastal erosion (effect). Given that one of the causes of climate change is precisely coastal erosion - through sea-level rise and increased storminess - the contribution of wave farms to its mitigation is indeed welcome. As for adaptation, wave farms - which typically consist of floating WECs - adapt naturally to sea-level rise; this is a major advantage relative to conventional coastal defense schemes, based on fixed structures (seawalls, detached breakwaters, groynes, etc.). © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Aegir dynamo; Anaconda; Beach erosion; Beach morphology; Breakwater; Carbon emission; CETO; Climate change; Coastal erosion; Coastal flooding; Coastal structure; Externalities; Field data; Greenhouse gas; Increased storminess; Levelized cost of energy (LCOE); Numerical modeling; Offshore wind; Oscillating body; Oscillating water column (OWC); Overtopping; Pelamis; PowerBuoy; Sea state; Sea-level rise; Seadog; Seawall; Seawave slot-cone generator; Sediment transport; Wave buoys; Wave dragon; Wave energy; Wave energy conversion; Wave energy converter; Wave farm; Wave power; Wave propagation; Wave resource; Wave spectrum; Wave-activated body; Wave-powered diaphragm pump; Waveberg; WaveCat; WaveStar; WEC array","Beaches; Breakwaters; Carbon; Climate change; Electric equipment protection; Energy conversion; Environmental impact; Erosion; Floods; Free energy; Greenhouse gases; Numerical models; Ocean currents; Offshore wind farms; Retaining walls; Sea level; Sediment transport; Shore protection; Solar energy; Storms; Wave power; Wave propagation; Anaconda; Beach erosion; Beach morphologies; Carbon emissions; CETO; Coastal erosion; Coastal flooding; Coastal structures; Diaphragm pumps; Externalities; Field data; Increased storminess; Levelized cost of energies; Offshore winds; Oscillating body; Oscillating water column; Overtopping; Pelamis; PowerBuoy; Sea level rise; Sea state; Seadog; Seawave slot-cone generator; Wave buoys; Wave dragon; Wave energy; Wave energy converters; Wave farms; Wave resource; Wave spectra; Waveberg; WaveCat; WaveStar; WEC array; Wave energy conversion","Iglesias, G.; School of Marine Science and Engineering, United Kingdom; email: gregorio.iglesias@plymouth.ac.uk",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319144092; 9783319144085,,,"English","Handb. of Climate Change Mitig. and Adaptation, Second Edition",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024848055

Obtaining metal resources from urban mines (waste) for supporting the civilization of human races will contribute not only to support sustainable development of civilization society to the future but also to mitigate climate change. Urban mines are one of the promising resources especially for poor natural metal resource countries such as Japan. Fortunately, Japan is one of the major rare metal consumers and also is capable of smelting rare metal by its own. Japan’s urban mine will be more practical with top class recycling technology. In addition to these technological developments, it is necessary to reform the society system in order to realize productive and economical urban mines which overcome the natural mine. Furthermore, in order to continue a steady development of rare metal recycling, it is necessary to conduct well-planned technology development based on the prediction of the future material usage.

On the one hand, the increase in per capita wealth reduces susceptibility to environmental pollutants. On the other hand, industrialization may increase the emissions of those same pollutants. Global climate policy negotiations have recognized this conflict, striving to identify a pathway to decarbonize the global economy while allowing growth in world regions at the bottom of the economic pyramid.

The Presidential Regulation No. 61/Year 2011 on the National Action Plan on GHG emission reduction (RAN-GRK) was issued to achieve this voluntary commitment. In addition, the Presidential Regulation No. 71/Year 2011 on national GHG inventory was issued with the objective of providing regular information on status and trend of GHG emissions and removals. The institutional arrangement related to climate change mitigation, including several funding mechanisms such as the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), has also been developed in Indonesia. These initiatives are linked with international reporting requirements. To comply with the more regular and frequent reporting requirement, Indonesia will need to make a transition from a temporary project-based approach to a more permanent and institution-based approach. © Springer Japan 2016.

Greenhouse gasses (GHG) emitted from human activities as well as from natural ecosystem are the main cause for climate change. Rise in atmospheric GHG like CH4, N2O, and CO2 are the main cause of global change. Renewable bioenergy holds promise to resolve energy crisis and countries across the globe are driven exploring different sources of bioenergy. One such is bioenergy from Jatropha curcas, which is widely recognized as source for biodiesel. Intensive cultivation of Jatropha is under serious consideration globally, but there is need of better understanding of how this plant can be used not only for biodiesel but also for agriculture and climate mitigation as well. Manuscript addresses perspective of J. curcas towards improving soil biological health, carbon sequestration and greenhouse gas emission reduction. J. curcas harbors many important microbial species in its rhizosphere including N fixers, P solubilizers, PGPRs, mycorrhiza fungi etc. Many important arbuscular mycorrhizae belonging to Acaulospora sp., Gigaspora sp., Glomus sp., Sclerocystis sp. and Scutellospora sp. Bacterial species like Azotobacter, Rhizobium, Pleomorphomonas diazotrophica, Bacillus megaterium, Bacillus thuringiensis has been found associated with J. curcas rhizosphere. These microbial groups are the key to improve soil function important for agriculture and maintaining soil health. Manuscript highlights different bioactive molecules like organic acids, amyrin, flavonoids, phytates, etc present in different parts of the J. curcas and perspective improving agriculture. J. curcas cultivated in one hectare of land can absorb as much as 25 tonnes of CO2 yr-1. Due to high photosynthesis rate, J. curcas accumulates significant amounts of C to soil. Overall, a 3 - 5 year old plantation may add around 4000 kg plant biomass equivalent yr-1. Manuscript highlights C sequestration potential of J. curcas in different ecological scenarios and usefulness rehabilitating degraded lands. J. curcas biomass significantly stimulates CH4 and CO2 production from soil and inhibits CH4 consumption activity. Amendment of J. curcas biomass at 1% level increased CH4 production potential of soil to nearly 50-fold than un-amended soil. Soil CO2 production also doubled when the J. curcas biomass was added. Data reveal optimum level of biomass incorporation to manage its biomass and at the same time mitigate GHG emission. Manuscript concluded with recommendation of J. curcas cultivation and approaches managing agriculture, ecosystem and global change issues. © 2016 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

According to the club approach, it would be promising to start with small groups of “enthusiastic” countries. These countries would outline what they are willing and able to do, conditional on what other enthusiastic countries offer and implement. Moreover, these enthusiastic countries would try to entice “reluctant” countries to join via “exclusive and contingent” measures. Focusing on the conditions for a climate club to effectively reduce global emissions, we organize our review around four main questions: first, what is a climate club’s potential for providing benefits that accrue exclusively to club members? Second, how might leadership influence a climate club’s ability to eventually become effective? Third, what insights can the formal modelling literature offer concerning the effectiveness of climate clubs? Finally, which is the empirical record of existing climate clubs?

Agroforestry may potentially improve livelihood through simultaneous production of food, fodder, timber and firewood as well as mitigation and adaptation to climate change. This chapter critically examines the role of agroforestry in natural resource (soil, water, nutrients, biodiversity) conservation, livelihood security (goods and services to society), providing social and economic well-being to people and carbon sequestration. Moreover, the role of agroforestry is more pronounced and relevant in degraded and fragile agroecosystems, such as the Himalayas. Agroforestry in the Himalayas contributes significantly to ecological, social and economic functions and serves as complementary to natural forests. Therefore, a winning strategy for natural resource conservation and human welfare in the fragile Himalayas can be achieved by promoting scientific agroforestry practices to reconcile food production with conservation in climate change scenario. Agroforestry needs to be strengthened by developing appropriate innovative technologies, community participation, domestication, strong policy support and establishing strong market linkages. Similarly, efforts are needed to promote science-based decision-making, and future thrust is required to remove the remaining uncertainties and to also carefully test the agroforestry practices against other land uses in Himalayan ecosystems in order to know their suitability and to what extent agroforestry can serve mankind and ecosystems. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Agroforestry; Climate change; Ecosystems; Mitigation; Natural resource",,"Palsaniya, D.R.; ICAR-Indian Grassland, India; email: drpalsaniya@gmail.com",,"Springer Singapore",,9789811025587; 9789811025570,,,"English","Conservation Agriculture: An Approach to Combat Climate Change in Indian Himalaya",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018587255

The major underlying cause is anthropogenic, i.e. excessive use of fossil fuels, destruction of forests for industrialisation and urbanisation with rapid overgrowing population. The danger is such alarming that ecosystem will be irreversibly altered which will lead to suffering of human life by many ways. The overriding appearance of climate change is the increasing average worldwide temperature which is popularly called as global warming, and as a consequence several regions of the Earth are facing visible problems such as melting of glaciers, sea level rising, deviations in precipitation patterns and increase in plant diseases, and a number of bourgeoning challenges for public health are coming across by many nations. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, the Indian Himalayan ecosystem (IHE) is one of the extremely vulnerable zones followed by the coastal ecosystem towards the climate change in India, and as per projection the climate change will impart serious environmental, economic and social impacts of the Indian Himalaya agricultural production system. At this juncture, strong adaptation and mitigation strategy is needed for reducing the vulnerability of resource-poor hill farmers and sustainable development of the Himalayan ecosystem. Climate change adaptation involves holistic changes in agricultural and ecological management practices. It comprises a combination of distinct responses, the indigenous knowledge systems, alternative practices and accessible technologies. Adaptation policy should be taking into account the farmers’ perspective. In this piece of writing, the focus is to draw an outline of present condition and, furthermore, propose a strategy for effective adaptation and mitigation of climate change suited for Himalayan agricultural system. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Adaptation and mitigation; Climate change; Evergreen agriculture; Indian Himalaya; Modelling",,"Rakshit, S.; ICAR-Vivekananda Institute of Hill AgricultureIndia; email: rakshitshantanu90@gmail.com",,"Springer Singapore",,9789811025587; 9789811025570,,,"English","Conservation Agriculture: An Approach to Combat Climate Change in Indian Himalaya",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018566934

In hills of Uttarakhand, agriculture and animal husbandry are the main occupations, and therefore, food and nutritional security much more depends on favorable climatic conditions. Crop productivity in the hilly areas is getting reduced because of low soil fertility and higher pest and disease infestations. The persistent changes in weather conditions have resulted in overall decrease in the water level in almost all the water sources of the area. The area under irrigation is decreasing gradually due to drying of most of the water bodies for irrigation resulting in low productivity of crops. Rising temperature has led to the shift in forest biodiversity. Pine trees have replaced broad leaf tree species which is posing a major threat to fodder availability and have resulted in increased forest fire incidents. People in hill region have learned to live and survive with risks for thousands of years, but the present rate of climate change is very rapid which demands much attention for the socioeconomic concerns in the area. Women in hills are involved in maintaining and promoting agricultural genetic diversity by selecting, conserving, and propagating seeds. Participatory adaptation strategies with women involved at every stage must be framed as they have rich traditional knowledge and experience with respect to crop adaptation to enhance food security. Drought-resistant crop varieties should be promoted to address drought-like situations and instances of less rain during cropping seasons. Dual-purpose crop varieties which can be grown for grain as well as for fodder could save a lot of time and drudgery of women involved in carrying back-breaking load up and down in hilly terrains. Developmental policies and strategies should be supportive to enhance access and control of men and women over natural resources in order to conserve natural resources, alleviate poverty, and ensure that vulnerable groups including women are enabled to cope with the climate change. © Springer Science+Business Media Singapore 2016.","Adaptation; Climate change; Himalayas; Mitigation",,"Jethi, R.; ICAR-Vivekananda Institute of Hill AgricultureIndia; email: renujethi2009@gmail.com",,"Springer Singapore",,9789811025587; 9789811025570,,,"English","Conservation Agriculture: An Approach to Combat Climate Change in Indian Himalaya",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018541156

Clean cookstoves represent the best substitute for open fire biomass stoves and reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from fuelwood globally. Prospects to transfer this technology to Botswana have not been explored. Therefore, our research objectives were to transfer the clean Institutional Cookstove (IC) technology to ORI as a case study, quantify the amount of fuelwood it consumes in comparison to traditional biomass energy system, and analyze its potential to be used as a substitute for open fire cooking method. The clean IC technology transfer was successfully done within two weeks before testing its energy efficiency and financial viability. It used about two-thirds less fuelwood as compared to the three stone traditional stove. Financial viability analysis of the clean IC as a model to be used in primary schools showed that it has a potential to reduce money spent on fuelwood. Our future work will focus on analyzing carbondioxide gas emissions from using clean IC in comparison to open fire method. The challenge remains on how to rollout the clean IC to schools, and adapting it to the three legged pot.","Clean energy; Clean institutional cookstoves; Climate change mitigation; Energy efficiency; Forest conservation; Sustainable biomass carbon","Biomass; Botnet; Conservation; Energy efficiency; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Integrated circuits; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Societies and institutions; Stoves; Sustainable development; Technology transfer; Water management; Water resources; Wood products; Clean energy; Climate change mitigation; Cooking methods; Financial viability; Forest conservation; Research objectives; Sustainable utilization; Traditional biomass; Climate change",,,"Acta Press",,9780889869844,,,"English","Proc.

Of particular importance is the influence of climatic conditions on the growth of Aspergillus flavus and production of their toxins. Nevertheless, little is known about the actual impact of climate change on the issue. Setting up of relevant measures to manage the impact has therefore become a daunting task especially in developing nations. Therefore, this study aimed at providing adaptation and mitigation options to manage this risk with a special focus on Kenya where cases of aflatoxicosis have been recurrent. We used a systematic literature review of review and research articles, with limited searching but systematic screening to explore available qualitative and quantitative data. Projections from the data, showed that on average, a 58.9% increase of aflatoxin contamination in the Central and Western parts and a decrease of 44.6% in the Eastern and Southern parts is expected but with several possible scenarios. This makes the impact of climate change on aflatoxin contamination in Kenya complex. To protect the public and environment from the negative impact, a regulatory framework that allows for an integrated management of aflatoxins in a changing climate was proposed. The management practices in the framework are divided into agronomic, post-harvest and institutional levels. Given the multiple points of application, coordination amongst stakeholders along the chain is fundamental. We therefore proposed a complimentary framework that allows the food safety issues to be addressed in an integrated manner while allowing for transparent synergies and trade-offs (in implementing the measures). A policy-oriented foresight should be carried out to provide policy based evidence for the applicability of the proposed adaptation and mitigation measures. © 2016 Wageningen Academic Publishers.","Aflatoxin; Aspergillus flavus; Food safety; Regulatory framework; Weather factors","aflatoxin; adaptation; aflatoxicosis; Aspergillus flavus; biological pest control; carbon footprint; climate change; cotton; environmental temperature; food chain; food contamination; food safety; fungus growth; harvest; Kenya; maize; microbial diversity; nonhuman; Review; soil",,,"Wageningen Academic Publishers",18750710,,,,"English","World Mycotoxin J.",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012067929

However, only the leverage and risk are significant to the cost of equity. Interestingly, our research also discovered the unexpected direction for the relationship between CCM and the cost of equity, which is a positive relationship. This implies that the higher disclosure of CCM increases the cost of equity for the firms. In short, firms have to exchange to compromise between a lower cost of equity or a better environment.

Moreover, a lack of historical household-level yield data has made it difficult to quantify the level of basis risk and the impact on farmer welfare. This paper utilizes a unique dataset of plot-level historical rice yields in Northeastern Tanzania to estimate the level of basis risk and the welfare implications of two hypothetical index insurance contracts. One is a standard area-yield contract, while the other uses an index based on publicly available high-resolution satellite data that are mapped to actual yields to minimize basis risk. Our results suggest that the satellite index explains approximately 55 % of the variation in zone-level yields across years. Moreover, despite the presence of large basis risk under both contracts, they are each found to improve the welfare of the average farmer in the sample. Finally, we show that the demand for satellite contracts may be as high as 30 % under reasonable assumptions about loading costs and risk preferences. © Springer International Publishing AG 2016.","Agriculture; Basis risk; Index insurance; Microinsurance; Remote sensing; Tanzania",,"Flatnes, J.E.; Department of Agricultural, United States; email: flatnes.1@osu.edu",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319412382; 9783319412368,,,"English","Climate Change and Multi-Dimensional Sustainability in African Agriculture: Climate Change and Sustainability in Agriculture",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009689414

To illustrate use of the model, a representative dairy farm in central New York was simulated over 25 years of recent historical weather to determine the environmental benefits and economic costs of alternative manure handling strategies. Use of an enclosed manure storage with a flare to burn the methane produced decreased the farm-gate carbon footprint of the milk produced by 20% at an increased annual cost of $42 cow-1. Using an anaerobic digester to produce gas and electricity used on the farm reduced the carbon footprint by 19% and reduced profitability by $56 cow-1. The addition of subsurface injection of manure along with a reduction in N fertilizer use greatly reduced ammonia emission from the farm and increased annual profit by $9 cow-1. Climate change is projected to affect many aspects of dairy production, including growing season length, crop growth processes, harvest timing and losses, cattle performance, nutrient emissions and losses, and ultimately farm profitability. Climate projections for high and low emission scenarios were downscaled from nine general circulation models. IFSM was then used to simulate the same New York dairy farm over 25-year periods using recent, mid-century, and late century climate projected by each of the climate models. Simulations were done without and with adaptation through modified crop varieties and planting and harvest dates. Forage production normally increased with projected climate change and corn grain yields decreased, and together feed production was maintained. Warmer temperatures increased volatile loss of ammonia N, and changes in precipitation patterns increased nutrient runoff losses in surface water. The reactive N footprint of the milk produced was increased by 2% to 11% with the change in climate, but other environmental footprints were relatively unaffected. With appropriate adaptation to climate change, annual farm profitability increased by about $100 cow-1. However, for the high emission, late century projection, profit decreased by $10 cow-1 and the risk or annual variance in profit increased by 34%, reflecting greater annual variation in crop and animal productivity. Whole-farm and climate models provide useful tools for studying the benefits and costs of greenhouse gas mitigation and the adaptation of farms to changing climate. © 2016 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Adaptation; Climate change; Farm model; Greenhouse gas; IFSM; Mitigation","Ammonia; Carbon footprint; Climate models; Costs; Crops; Dairies; Environmental impact; Farms; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Manures; Nutrients; Profitability; Surface waters; Adaptation; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Farm model; Greenhouse gas mitigation; IFSM; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mitigation; Climate change; adaptive management; annual variation; carbon footprint; climate change; cost analysis; cost-benefit analysis; dairy farming; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; general circulation model; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; mitigation; performance assessment; surface water; variance analysis; New York [United States]; United States; Animalia; Bos; Zea mays","Rotz, C.A.; USDA-ARS Pasture Systems and Watershed Management Research Unit, Building 3702, Curtin Road, United States; email: al.rotz@ars.usda.gov",,"American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers",21510032,,,,"English","Trans.

The majority (75%) of the farmers were aware of climate change within their environment. Self-observation and experience (42.4%) over the years was the source of awareness of climate change. The majority (73.6%) of the farmers opined that in recent times, flooding had increased which is an indication of climate change. Reduction in the use of generator to get power in the farmers' houses (69.1%) and crop rotation practices (67.3%) were mitigation and adaptation strategies employed by the farmers against the effect of climate change.

Life cycle assessment (LCA) is applied to compare the climate change impact (CC) of a reinforced concrete (RC) benchmark structure to the CC of an alternative timber structure for four buildings ranging from 3 to 21 storeys. The timber structures are dimensioned to meet the same load criteria as the benchmark structures. The LCA comprises three calculation approaches differing in analysis perspective, allocation methods, and modelling of biogenic CO2 and carbonation of concrete. Irrespective of the assumptions made, the timber structures cause lower CC than the RC structures. By applying attributional LCA, the timber structures are found to cause a CC that is 34-84% lower than the RC structures. The large span is due to different building heights and methodological assumptions. The CC saving per m2 floor area obtained by substituting a RC structure with a timber structure decrease slightly with building height up to 12 storeys, but increase from 12 to 21 storeys. From a consequential LCA perspective, constructing timber structures can result in avoided GHG emissions, indicated by a negative CC.

Its versatility and capacity to generate negative emissions when combined with carbon capture and storage add degrees of freedom to the timing of emission reductions. This paper aims to explore the robustness of a bioenergy-based mitigation strategy by addressing several dimensions of uncertainty on biomass potential, bioenergy use and induced land use change emissions. Design/methodology/approach: Different mitigation scenarios were explored by two different energy-economy optimization models coupled to the same land use model, which provides a common basis for the second generation bioenergy dynamics in the two energy-economy models. Findings: Using bioenergy is found to be a robust mitigation strategy as demonstrated by high biomass shares in primary energy demand in both models and in all mitigation scenarios. Practical implications: A variety of possible storylines about future uses of biomass exist. The comparison of the technology choices preferred by the applied models helps understand how future emission reductions can be achieved under alternative storylines. Originality/value: The presented comparison-based assessment goes beyond other comparison studies because both energy-economy models are coupled to the same land use model. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.","Bioenergy; Climate change mitigation; Energy system; Land use","bioenergy; biomass; climate change; economic activity; emission control; land use change; numerical model; strategic approach","Leimbach, M.; Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact ResearchGermany; email: leimbach@pik-potsdam.de",,"Emerald Group Publishing Ltd.",17568692,,,,"English","Int.

Using Sweden as an example, we present an approach that combines global and national land-use and forest models to analyze impacts of climate change mitigation ambitions on forest management and harvesting in a specific country. National forest impact analyses in Sweden have traditionally focused on supply potential with little reference to international market developments. In this study, we use the global greenhouse gas concentration scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel for Climate Change to estimate global biomass demand and assess potential implications on harvesting and biodiversity in Sweden. The results show that the short-term demand for wood is close to the full harvesting potential in Sweden in all scenarios. Under high bioenergy demand, harvest levels are projected to stay high over a longer time and particularly impact the harvest levels of pulpwood. The area of old forest in the managed landscape may decrease. This study highlights the importance of global scenarios when discussing national-level analysis and pinpoints trade-offs that policy making in Sweden may need to tackle in the near future. © 2016, Canadian Science Publishing.

Taking a broader and consensual perspective, co-benefits are considered here to be emerging advantages of implementing measures to lower greenhouse gases. Starting with the analysis of policy documents referring to two European urban transportation strategies, the emergent co-benefits are problematized and discussed to better understand their moral aspect. Further ethical reflection is conducted after an analysis of some unintended consequences of the co-benefits rationale arising from the examples. The discussion focuses primarily on the challenges of an integrative moral justification for co-benefits and also for their role in the climate change mitigation effort. We also discuss the limitations of the current normative models that frame a co-benefits rationale, both from a moral viewpoint and in relation to the overall climate change mitigation strategy. In this article, we propose the concepts of well-being and freedom, as portrayed by the Capability Approach, as possible guiding notions for the moral and social evaluation of goodness of these emergent benefits as well as their rationale. Additionally, some preliminary conclusions are drawn regarding the potential of the presented concepts to support climate change mitigation action. Finally, we outline a scenario where the Capability Approach is the moral guideline for a co-benefits rationale and illustrates its potential in terms of enhancing climate change mitigation strategy.","Capabilities approach; Climate change; Co-benefits; Freedom; Well-being",,"Oliveira, R.V.; Department of Philosophy and Religious Studies, Norway; email: rita.bouman@ntnu.no",,"Akademika Forlag",18903991,,,,"English","Etikk Praksis",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Gold, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994544679

These risks include increased water scarcity, increased heat, and the introduction and emergence of vector-borne and other climate sensitive diseases. To respond to these threats, it is necessary for the government, at every level, to adopt more mitigation and adaptation strategies. Here, focus groups were conducted with representatives from five Lima municipalities to determine priorities, perception of climate change, and decision-making processes for implementing projects within each municipality. These factors can affect the ability and desire of a community to implement climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. The results show that climate change and other environmental factors are of relatively low priority, whereas public safety and water and sanitation services are of highest concern. Perhaps most importantly, climate change is not well understood among the municipalities. Participants had trouble distinguishing climate change from other environmental issues and did not fully understand its causes and effects. Greater understanding of what climate change is and why it is important is necessary for it to become a priority for the municipalities. Different aspects of increased climate change awareness seem to be connected to having experienced extreme weather events, whether related or not to climate change, and to higher socioeconomic status.

The study reviewed the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources which includes: Energy Security, Energy Access, Social and Economic development, Climate Change Mitigation, and reduction of environmental and health impacts. Despite these opportunities, there are challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources towards climate change mitigation. These challenges include Market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and our daily carbon footprint.

Eighty-five percent of respondents indicate that they are willing to pay at least 10 percent more than the market price for these products. The econometric analysis indicates that income, education, age and gender, as well as public awareness and concerns about climate change are significant factors influencing WTP. Respondents who are more knowledgeable and more concerned about the adverse effect of climate change show higher WTP. In comparison, income elasticity is small.

It considers the role of crop disease control in climate change mitigation, by estimating consequences for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of crop management strategies to control diseases, using UK oilseed rape and barley crops as examples. In this chapter we conclude that good control of crop diseases, resulting in more efficient use of nitrogen fertiliser, can decrease UK GHG from crop production by c. 1.6 Mt CO2 eq. each year. Within the chapter we discuss impacts of climate change on incidence of crop diseases and their effects on crop yields, using UK oilseed rape phoma stem canker and wheat fusarium ear blight as examples. For both these diseases, it is estimated that global warming will increase the range and severity of epidemics. To make such estimates, it is emphasised that it is important to estimate impacts of climate on both crop growth and disease development. In response to such projections of impacts of climate change, within this chapter we assess strategies for adaptation to climate change of crop disease management to decrease arable crop losses related to climate change, for both policymakers and farmers. © Springer Science+Business Media New York 2016.","Agricultural adaptation to climate change; Climate change mitigation; Crop diseases; Food security; Impacts on agriculture",,"Fitt, B.D.L.; School of Life and Medical Sciences, College Lane Campus, United Kingdom; email: b.fitt@herts.ac.uk",,"Springer New York",,9781493935369; 9781493935345,,,"English","Plant Genomics and Climate Change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84978246842

During 1750 the concentrations for these gases were 280 ppm, 715 ppb, and 270 ppb, respectively which increased to 379 ppm, 1774 ppb, and 319 ppb, respectively in 2005. It showed an increase of 0.23, 0.96, and 0.12% annually. The same has further increased to 385 ppm, 1797 ppb, and 322 ppb, respectively in 2008 representing 1.6, 1.2, and 0.9% increase, respectively from 2005 levels at an annual increase of 0.53, 0.43, and 0.31%, annually. Increase in atmospheric CO2 promotes growth and productivity of plants with C3 photosynthetic pathway but the increase in temperature, on the other hand, can reduce crop duration, increase crop respiration rates, affect the survival and distribution of pest populations, and may hasten nutrient mineralization in soils, decrease fertilizer-use efficiency, and increase evapotranspiration. The water resources which are already scarce may come under enhanced stress. Thus, the impact of climate change is likely to have a significant influence on agriculture and eventually on the food security and livelihoods of large sections of the urban and rural populations globally. The developing countries, particularly in South Asia and Latin America, with diverse agroclimatic regions, challenging geographies, growing economies, diverse agricultural production systems, and farm typologies are more vulnerable to the effect of climate change due to heavy dependence on agriculture for livelihood. These regions also are demonstrating poor coping mechanisms to adapt to these challenges, and as a result there is evidence of negative impacts on productivity of wheat, rice, and other crops to varying extent depending on agroecologies. Upscaling of modern technologies such as conservation and climate smart agriculture, judicious utilization of available water for agriculture through microirrigation and water saving technologies, developing multiple stress-tolerant crop cultivars and biotypes through biotechnological tools, restoration of degraded soils and waters, promoting carbon sequestration through alternate production technologies and land use, and conservation of biodiversity must be promoted at regional and country level to ensure durable food and nutritional security. Reliable early warning system of environmental changes, their spatial and temporal magnitude, coupled with policies to support the diffusion of this information, can help interpret these forecasts in terms of their agronomic and economic implications for the benefit of farmers and to provide agriculture-dependent industries and policymakers with more informed options to support farmers. These countries need to formulate both short-term and long-term policies for improvement, sustenance, and protection of natural resources. There is an urgent need for capacity building through international collaboration in order to develop databases and analysis systems for efficient weather forecasting as well as preparing contingency plans for vulnerable areas. The objectives of this paper are to summarize the available information on adaptation strategies and the mitigation options for climate change to meet the food security in South Asia and Latin America. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.","Crop diversification; Crop simulation; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation; Mulching; Sequestering; Water management",,"Jat, M.L.; International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre (CIMMYT), NASC Complex, India; email: M.Jat@cgiar.org","Sparks D.L.","Academic Press Inc.",00652113,9780128046920,,,"English","Adv.

They can thereby help to mitigate climate change-induced impacts and serve as proactive adaptation options for municipalities. We explore the various contexts in which nature-based solutions are relevant for climate mitigation and adaptation in urban areas, identify indicators for assessing the effectiveness of nature-based solutions and related knowledge gaps. In addition, we explore existing barriers and potential opportunities for increasing the scale and effectiveness of nature-based solution implementation. The results were derived from an inter- and transdisciplinary workshop with experts from research, municipalities, policy, and society. As an outcome of the workshop discussions and building on existing evidence, we highlight three main needs for future science and policy agendas when dealing with nature-based solutions: (i) produce stronger evidence on nature-based solutions for climate change adaptation and mitigation and raise awareness by increasing implementation; (ii) adapt for governance challenges in implementing nature-based solutions by using reflexive approaches, which implies bringing together new networks of society, nature-based solution ambassadors, and practitioners; (iii) consider socio-environmental justice and social cohesion when implementing nature-based solutions by using integrated governance approaches that take into account an integrative and transdisciplinary participation of diverse actors. Taking these needs into account, nature-based solutions can serve as climate mitigation and adaptation tools that produce additional cobenefits for societal well-being, thereby serving as strong investment options for sustainable urban planning. © 2016 by the author(s).","Climate change; Cobenefits; Governance; Nature-based solutions; Urban areas","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; knowledge; sustainable development; urban area; urban planning; vulnerability","Kabisch, N.Permoserstrasse 15, Germany; email: nadja.kabisch@ufz.de",,"Resilience Alliance",17083087,,,,"English","Ecol.

Terrestrial vegetation, especially forestry and agroforestry systems have been prioritized to stock CO2 through phototropic sequestration. Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis), primarily managed for latex production, is explored in this contribution for its role in vegetation carbon stock management and climate change mitigation. The present study was carried out in selected Hevea stands aged between 5 and 40 years from Barak Valley, part of North East India. A total of 67 trees were harvested to estimate the biomass carbon stock in above- and below-ground components in plantations of different age groups. The study revealed that plantation density of 688-784 trees ha-1 is managed under plantations of different age groups. Total biomass (above and below ground) increased from 41 kg tree-1 under 5-10 years to 307 kg tree-1 under 30-40 years age group of plantations. Total vegetation carbon stock (Mg ha-1; above and below ground) ranged from 16.00 (5-10 years) to 105.73 (30-40 years), which is more than many tropical forestry and agroforestry systems across the world. Vegetation carbon sequestration rate revealed that 2.56 mg C ha-1 year-1 organic carbon is being accumulated in Hevea plantations. Considering the economic profitability from Hevea plantation management (through latex production) and its capability to stock high-biomass carbon, restoring degraded and secondary forests through this species will improve livelihood security and advance climate change mitigation strategies.","Agroforestry systems; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Rubber plantations",,"Nath, A.J.; Department of Ecology and Environmental Science, India; email: arunjyotinath@gmail.com",,"Indian Academy of Sciences",00113891,,CUSCA,,"English","Curr.

These modifications have drastically affected the structures and functions of natural and agricultural ecosystems in terrestrial and aquatic areas. In this manuscript, we first present a modified view of the global N cycle that includes N transport, conversion, and exchange processes. Second, several crucial issues concerning N balance, including N deposition and excessive addition and the dynamics of N and other nutrients, are reviewed. Third, the effects of climate change factors, including water status, warming, and elevated CO2 concentrations, on N balance and the N cycle and their interactions within and with other environmental factors are outlined. Finally, intervention strategies for improving N balance and N cycling to address rapid continual climatic change and socio-economic development are presented and discussed. It is highlighted that the altered N balance and N cycle between the geosphere, biosphere, and atmosphere have produced the profoundly critical challenge of maintaining N levels within an appropriate range, which should be considered by relevant people and sectors, including researchers, managers, and policy makers from ecological, environmental, and sustainable development sectors. © 2016 Published by NRC Research Press.","Climate change; Excessive nitrogen addition; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen management; Terrestrial ecosystems","Aquatic ecosystems; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Economics; Ecosystems; Nitrogen; Planning; Sustainable development; Nitrogen additions; Nitrogen cycles; Nitrogen deposition; Nitrogen management; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change","Xu, Z.; State Key Laboratory of Vegetation and Environmental Change, China; email: xuzz@ibcas.ac.cn",,"Canadian Science Publishing",11818700,,ENRVE,,"English","Environ Rev",Review,"Final","All Open Access, Green",Scopus,2-s2.0-84971450226

During such process, occlusion of carbon (C) also takes place within the phytoliths called phytolith occluded C (PhytOC). The PhyOC is highly stable and may substantially contribute to long-term terrestrial C sequestration. The present study aimed to investigate the phytolith and PhytOC contents variability in rice cultivars and its potential for long-term terrestial C biosequestration.The results indicate that dry matter yield of rice cultivars varied from 15.52 to 28.82 g plant-1and, the PhytOC contents of straw, root, husk, and grains range from0.22-0.68%, 0.09-0.22%, 0.43-0.82% and 0.002-0.024%, respectively. The PhytOC content of rice depends on the content of phytoliths and the efficiency of C occlusion within the phytoliths. The C sequestration rates of rice cultivars are approximately 0.05 - 0.12 Mg of C dioxide equivalents (Mg-e-CO2) ha-1 year-1. Assuming maximum phytolith C biosequestration rate of 0.12 Mg-e-CO2 ha-1 year-1, the global annual potential sink rate of PhytOC in soils through rice phytoliths would approximately be 16.4 Tg-e-CO2. Therefore rice crop may play a significant role in long-term C sequestration through PhytOC. © 2016, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Carbon biosequestration; Phytolith occluded carbon; Plant silica; Rice cultivars",,"Rajendiran, S.; ICAR-Indian Institute of Soil Science, Berasia Road, India; email: rajanselladurai@yahoo.co.in",,"Corvinus University of Budapest",15891623,,,,"English","Appl.

Each chapter has been written by experts in plant-stress biology and highlights the involvement of a variety of genes/pathways and their regulation in abiotic stress, recent advances in molecular breeding (identification of tightly liked markers, QTLs/genes), transgenesis (introduction of exogenous genes or changing the expression of endogenous stress- responsive genes) and genomics approaches that have made it easier to identify and isolate several key genes involved in abiotic stress such as drought, water lodging/flooding, extreme temperatures, salinity and heavy-metal toxicity. Food and nutritional security has emerged as a major global challenge due to expanding populations, and cultivated areas becoming less productive as a result of extreme climatic changes adversely affecting the quantity and quality of plants. Hence, there is an urgent need to develop crop varieties resilient to abiotic stress to ensure food security and combat increased input costs, low yields and the marginalization of land. The role of GM crops in poverty alleviation, nutrition and health in developing countries and their feasibility in times of climate change are also discussed. Recent advances in gene technologies have shown the potential for faster, more targeted crop improvements by transferring genes across the sexual barriers.

The only relatively widely deployed strategy is emissions trading. The remaining strategies, including process emissions reduction, combustion emissions reduction, external measures, and lowering product output are not deployed extensively.

Unless mitigated, the soil organic carbon and nitrogen loss resulting from removing agricultural residues for biofuel production may cause life cycle greenhouse gas emissions to surpass national policy thresholds, and thus risk non-compliance with renewable fuel policy. Strategies to mitigate soil organic carbon loss such as using nutrient and carbon-rich, and stable land amendments will lead to time-variable greenhouse gas credits. Recent studies have argued for using time-dependent rather than time-averaged radiative forcing methods for biofuel greenhouse gas accounting but few life cycle assessment studies have examined the impact of time-varying emissions of soil organic carbon using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change tier 3 models. This study applies a time-dependent radiative forcing approach to a 100-year time-series data set of life cycle greenhouse gas emissions for lignocellulosic ethanol that includes temporally variable soil greenhouse gas emissions. This study demonstrates that averaging soil emissions and neglecting the time when the sequestration or release occurs within a selected time horizon can lead to a 9% to over 80% overestimation of the magnitude of the effect of the mitigation strategy. This affirms that employing strategies to maintain soil organic carbon stock early within a biofuel program supports climate change mitigation. Such strategies would guide farmers to best manage soil carbon within the biofuel production life cycle. Time-dependent approaches underscore the need for early measures of greenhouse gas curtailment to support sustainable renewable biofuel and agricultural policy. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

However, there is limited knowledge on how the planning and promotion of synergies between M + A can be operationalized in the current efforts to mitigate climate change through forest carbon. This paper contributes to fill this knowledge gap by exploring ways of planning and promoting M + A synergy outcomes in forest carbon initiatives. It examines eight guidelines that are widely used in designing and implementing forest carbon initiatives. Four guiding principles with a number of criteria that are relevant for planning synergy outcomes in forest carbon activities are proposed. The guidelines for developing forest carbon initiatives need to demonstrate that (1) the health of forest ecosystems is maintained or enhanced; (2) the adaptive capacity of forest-dependent communities is ensured; (3) carbon and adaptation benefits are monitored and verified; and (4) adaptation outcomes are anticipated and planned in forest carbon initiatives. The forest carbon project development guidelines can encourage the integration of adaptation in forest carbon initiatives. However, their current efforts guiding projects and programs to deliver biodiversity and environmental benefits, ecosystem services, and socioeconomic benefits are not considered explicitly as efforts towards enhancing adaptation. An approach for incentivizing and motivating project developers, guideline setters, and offset buyers is imperative in order to enable existing guidelines to make clear contributions to adaptation goals. We highlight and discuss potential ways of incentivizing and motivating the explicit planning and promotion of adaptation outcomes in forest carbon initiatives. © 2016 by the authors.","Adaptation; Biodiversity and social benefits; Carbon stocks sustainability; Forest carbon; Mitigation; Synergy","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Ecosystems; Land use; Mergers and acquisitions; Motivation; Sustainable development; Adaptation; Carbon stocks; Forest carbons; Mitigation; Social benefits; Synergy; Forestry; adaptive management; biodiversity; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; sustainability","Chia, E.L.; Messa, P.O.

The stabilization scenarios informing the recent IPCC's Fifth Assessment Report suggest that bioenergy could contribute anywhere between 10 and 245 EJ to climate change mitigation in 2100. High deployment of bioenergy with low life cycle GHG emissions would enable ambitious climate stabilization futures and reduce demands on other sectors and options. Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) would even enable so-called negative emissions, possibly in the order of magnitude of 50% of today's annual gross emissions.

I find that high future yield assumptions, plausible in stabilization scenarios, look less realistic when evaluated in biophysical metrics. Yield assumptions also determine the magnitude of counterfactual land carbon stock development and partially determine the potential of BECCS. High fertilizer input required for high yields would likely hasten ecosystem degradation. I conclude that land-based mitigation strategies remain highly speculative; a constant iteration between synoptic integrated assessment models and more particularistic and fine-grained approaches is a crucial precondition for capturing complex dynamics and biophysical constraints that are essential for comprehensive assessments. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","BECCS; Bioenergy; Biophysical limits; Climate change; Life cycle emissions; Risks; Yields","Biophysics; Carbon capture; Ecology; Greenhouse gases; Risks; Stabilization; BECCS; Bio-energy; Biophysical limits; Life cycle emissions; Yields; Climate change; bioenergy; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis","Creutzig, F.; Mercator Research Institute on Global Commons and Climate Change, Torgauer Straße 12-15, Germany; email: creutzig@mcc-berlin.net",,"Blackwell Publishing Ltd",17571693,,,,"English","GCB Bioenergy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84954237698

Box 1000FIN-02044, Finland","This paper considers the optimal rotation of forests when the carbon flows from forest growth and harvest are priced with an increasing price. Such evolution of carbon price is generally associated with economically efficient climate change mitigation, and would provide incentives for the land-owner for enhanced carbon sequestration. For an infinitely long sequence of even-aged forest rotations, the optimal harvest age changes with subsequent rotations due to the changing carbon price. The first-order optimality conditions therefore also involve an infinite chain of lengths for consecutive forest rotations, and allow the approximation of the infinite-time problem with a truncated series of forest rotations.Illustrative numerical calculations show that when starting from bare land, the initial carbon price and its growth rate both primarily increase the length of the first rotation. With some combinations of the carbon pricing parameters, the optimal harvest age can be several hundred years if the forest carbon is released to the atmosphere upon harvest. In the near term, however, a higher growth rate of carbon price can lead to shorter rotations for forests that are already near their optimal rotation age, indicating that the effect of carbon price dynamics on optimal rotation is not entirely monotonous. The introduction of carbon pricing can also have a significant impact on bare land value, and in some considered parametrizations the land value was based solely on its potential to capture and store atmospheric carbon. © 2015 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon pricing; Climate change mitigation; Optimal forest rotation","Costs; Economics; Forestry; Harvesting; Rotation; Atmospheric carbon; Carbon pricing; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Effect of carbons; First-order optimality condition; Forest rotation; Numerical calculation; Climate change","Ekholm, T.; VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland, P.O.

Box 260, Roskilde, DK 4000, Denmark","The growing interest in integrating climate change considerations into Programmes of Measures (PoMs) under the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) is being driven in part by the requirements of the next generation of River Basin Management Plans (RBMPs). However, so far most studies have focused on potential impacts of climate change on water bodies and the adaptation to climate change-related risks, whereas the relationship between RBMP's and mitigation of climate change - through the reduction in emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHG) - has only been touched upon. This paper investigates the potential for synergies between reduction of nutrient losses from agriculture and climate change mitigation in a case study of the Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord River Basin in Denmark. For this purpose, a map-based approach is applied to analyze the effects and cost-effectiveness of selected PoMs to reduce both nitrogen loads and GHG emissions from agriculture at the river basin scale. The results indicate a substantial potential for cost-effective integration of climate change mitigation into WFD action programmes with special emphasis on four agri-environmental N-GHG measures applied in combination: (1) manure treatment for biogas production and improved N utilization, (2) cultivation of perennial energy crops, (3) extensification of intensively farmed lowland areas and (4) wetland restoration. The particular PoMs investigated can ensure fulfilment of the WFD GES objectives for Isefjord and Roskilde Fjord in a cost-effective way and at the same time reduce GHG emissions significantly, corresponding to a 35-65% reduction of total agricultural GHG emissions within the river basin. This study suggests that a targeted and differentiated approach to the development of PoMs is necessary in order to attain the full potential of these kinds of win-win solutions in the context of the WFD. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Agriculture; Climate change mitigation; Decision support systems; Nutrients; Programmes of Measures; River basin management planning; Water Framework Directive","biogas; fossil fuel; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; agriculture; Article; carbon storage; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; Denmark; energy crop; land use; manure; priority journal; river basin; simulation","Kaspersen, B.S.; Department of Environmental, Social and Spatial Change, Roskilde University, Universitetsvej 1, P.O.

The entire route lies in Arctic waters, which due to global warming, has become ice free during summer and autumn. The route goes from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific Ocean along the Russian Arctic coast and reduces voyage distance by 40% between Northern Europe and Japan. Traditionally, comparisons of the climate impact of transport solutions have been based on fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO2), while other trace emissions in the exhaust gas have been ignored. It is becoming increasingly well-known however, that aerosols, and their precursors emitted from shipping are strong climate forcers, with a magnitude that is intimately connected to the specific region of emission. Taking into account these considerations, we apply region-specific Global Warming Potential (GWP) characterization factors to estimate the relative magnitude of the short-lived climate forcers in the Arctic compared to traditional shipping regions and to the impact of CO2 emissions in light of reduced overall fuel consumption. The results indicate that there are no general climate benefits of utilizing the Northern Sea Route, even with cleaner fuels, since the additional impact of emissions in the Arctic more than offsets the effect of shorter voyages. In terms of climate change mitigation, managing this trade-off will be challenging, as the Northern Sea Route offers cost savings per ton of freight transported. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.","Arctic; Emissions; Greenhouse gases; GWP; IMO; Shipping and environment","arctic environment; carbon emission; climate change; freight transport; greenhouse gas; savings; shipping; trade-off; Arctic","Lindstad, H.; Norwegian Marine Technology Research Institute (MARINTEK)Norway",,"Elsevier Ltd",0967070X,,,,"English","Transp.

Reductions can be justified in general by concerns about global climate change, oil depletion and supply security, and traffic casualties. In urban areas, additional concerns are air pollution, traffic congestion, take-up of land by transport infrastructure, and quality of urban life. Similarly, a variety of technological approaches are possible for addressing these problems in the context of global warming mitigation. This chapter examines policies for mobility reduction, as these can have a significant impact on climate change mitigation. It mainly restricts itself to the high-mobility countries of the OECD and uses four such countries (Australia, Japan, the UK, and the US) as case studies. The approaches considered here include: Using modern Information Technology (IT) advances to promote travel substitution Car pooling, especially in urban areas Land use planning, particularly increased urban densities Encouraging the use of more environmentally friendly travel modes Raising the overall level (and perhaps also changing the structure) of motoring costs Reducing the convenience of car travel. It is found that the use of IT, car pooling, and land use planning, whether voluntary or legislated, cannot be expected to produce much reduction in either car passenger-km or vehicle-km. Nor will reliance on voluntary approaches for car travel reduction by encouraging more use of environmentally friendly travel modes. Only the last two approaches can produce large and sustained reductions in travel greenhouse gas emissions, but heavy reliance on market forces such as very large increases in motoring costs is inequitable in OECD countries. The only equitable approach is to reduce the convenience of car travel, for example, by large travel speed reductions and by a reversal of the usual present ranking of travel modes: car, public transport, and active modes. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2012 and Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Active modes; Air travel; Australia; Australia; Australia; Buses; Cars; Cities; Coercive measures; Cycling; Environmentally friendly modes; Fuel costs; Future; Global climate change; Greenhouse gas; Information technology; International energy agency; Japan; Journey to work; Land use planning; Melbourne; Motoring costs; Netherlands; Non-motorized travel; Occupancy rate; OECD; Oil depletion; Personal mobility; Perth; Pro-environmental behavior; Public transport; Recycling; Road pricing; Telecommuting; Teleshopping; Tokyo; Traffic congestion; Trains; Trams; Transportation; Travel convenience; Travel demand management; Travel projections; Travel reduction; Travel speed; Travel time; United Kingdom; United States; Urban density; Vehicles; Voluntary measures","Binary alloys; Buses; Cost reduction; Economics; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Information technology; Land use; Motor transportation; Nonmotorized transportation; Petroleum transportation; Railroad cars; Recycling; Telecommuting; Transportation; Transportation charges; Travel time; Trolley cars; Urban planning; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Active mode; Air travels; Australia; Cities; Coercive measures; Cycling; Environmentally friendly modes; Fuel cost; Future; Global climate changes; International energy agency; Japan; Journey to works; Land Use Planning; Melbourne; Netherlands; Non-motorized travel; Occupancy rate; OECD; Oil depletion; Personal mobility; Perth; Pro-environmental behaviors; Public transport; Road pricing; Teleshopping; Tokyo; Trains; Trams; Travel convenience; Travel demand management; Travel projections; Travel speed; United kingdom; United States; Urban density; Voluntary measures; Traffic congestion","Moriarty, P.; Department of Design, Australia; email: patrick.moriarty@monash.edu",,"Springer International Publishing",,9783319144092; 9783319144085,,,"English","Handb. of Climate Change Mitig. and Adaptation, Second Edition",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879838725
